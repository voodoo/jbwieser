<p>​	At the age of 11 Joseph finished grammar school in Volkertshausen in and was sent to the Gymnasium in Radolfzell. There he was enrolled in a program designed to provide an educational background for those destined to remain in agriculture. Radolfzell was not far from Volkertshausen, but too far for him to remain living at home because it took simply too long to go back and forth on a daily basis. Consequently, beginning around March 1900, he lived away from home and returned only from time to time. It was during this time that he and his mother developed a stronger bond. Sending Joseph away to school had to have been hard for Maria. Perhaps that was why Wendelin consented so easily. With whom he boarded is not known, but he did send home laundry from time to time for Maria to wash. She returned the basket1 with clean clothes and with things for him to eat. In loaves of bread it was rumored she baked a gold coin or two from time to time so that he would have some money as well.2 There, in Radolfzell he was away from much of Wendelin’s wrath as well. He was also away at the birth of Ernst that October and for all practical purposes, he really had not grown up with or known a brother. Joseph never played with his brother, never shared things with him, and never did those things that brothers in most families did together. Anna and Ernst would naturally be drawn closer to one another. Always faithful to his mother, Joseph admired her courage and conviction to the family, but more and more, he began to resent his father and her toleration of him. Being away much of the week, he also missed a lot of what his mother and Anna had to endure. He was not there to offer any consolation when later his mother began to turn to him for advice.</p>

<p>​	He had fought hard to win his fight for an education. If Wendelin had had his way, Joseph would have never advanced to the gymnasium level. Joseph studied and learned well, but agriculture and family techniques was not developing as his main interest. In every way he became much smarter than his father, who had vowed to have none of his children become smarter than he. Joseph now demanded additional courses in order to guarantee himself prepared for employment at some professional level. He had decided that he would refuse to settle for remedial employment when the time came for earning a living. It would not be related to farming. He wanted to be a professional.</p>

<p>​	Joseph finished his college work sometime around mid-1908 according to a resume he submitted in 1916 to the US Consulate. On that application for employment at the State Department, he listed all his past employment and education. There are, however, about ten months unaccounted for following his completion of his education in Radolfzell in March 1906. It could have been that during this time, April 1906 that he joined the army as a reservist. Like so many his age, he enlisted in order to complete his military obligation to the Kaiser’s Army. That November he turned 18. Males, however, could enlist in the German Army at any age.</p>

<p>After completing his basic training, Joseph remained active with a reserve unit until some months into 1910.</p>

<center>101st Bavarian Infantry Reserves</center>

 	Joseph became of age at a time when German militarism was at its height. All youth were expected and required to serve in the army. After 1907 there was even a greater increase in military influence on policy making in Berlin. The German Army at this period was called a "State within the State". The parliament and the politicians often had to follow the lead of the German General Staff when it came to foreign issues.5  The army was, without any doubt, the supreme power in Germany. Joseph often related an incident that he had personally observed seeing an officer walking on a sidewalk. All civilians approaching an officer were required to step off the sidewalk and into the street. Those who failed to obey were frequently admonished or as Joseph witnessed, struck with the backside of his sword. Such was the respect that those in the military demanded. Even civilians knew their places. 

<p>​	Joseph enlisted and served in the 101st  Bavarian Infantry, a reserve unit, along with others whom he already may have known. All areas of Germany had been divided into districts and as in the American Civil War, many boys from the same town joined the military together so that they could remain and serve among friends with whom they had gone to school. Joseph was no exception and many with whom he had attended school in Radolfzoll enlisted together. Joseph would also later claim that all of his school comrades were killed in World War I and that he alone from among his classmates from Volkertshausen had survived. Since, among all his postcards, none are found to have been written after the war, this may indicate that his claim was true. While he completed his obligation to the army before the outbreak of the Great War, there is no doubt that had he remained in Germany, he would have been recalled to active service as the war continued. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In the army he also made new friends, and it was one of the few times that he became somewhat close to others. Certainly,</p>

<p>being finished with school was a much anticipated stage in the life of any young man. He had lived away at school for many years,</p>

<p>but now at last he was able to experience a greater freedom than he had ever known before. There, among his former classmates,</p>

<p>was true comradeship as only found among servicemen. Also, there was free time for hiking and drinking and doing all those things</p>

<p>that serviceman do so well together. Friends were meaningful to the extent that each wanted to keep in touch with the other as each</p>

<p>set out to advance their careers. All seemed to share experiences, love, and their uncertainties with one another as the new century</p>

<p>was entering its second decade.</p>

<p>That Joseph had been Volkertshausen’s “Struwwelpeter,”7  there can be no doubt. He loved to play pranks, especially on</p>

<p>those who by many were considered the town’s nerds as evidenced in a letter written to his sister in his last years of his life when he</p>

<p>reflected on his life in Volkertshausen. Every village had at least one child on whom other children picked or teased, and among the</p>

<p>members of the army, it was no different. Among those assigned to his barracks were at least two who filled that role. Joseph took</p>

<p>no pity on such individuals. From the way in which he told the story, it is clear that he was the ringleader. In order to bring more</p>

<p>unwarranted attention to these poor soldiers, Joseph and his gang secured a wine bottle of water under the springs of an upper bunk</p>

<p>of these soldier’s bunk beds. The bottle had been loosely stopped only by a partially fitted cork to which a string had been attached.</p>

<p>Now they waited until everyone had fallen asleep. One nerd had the lower bunk. His nemesis had the upper. Then one of the</p>

<p>pranksters, very likely Joseph, began tugging on the cork until its contents poured from the bottle, dousing the poor victim below.</p>

<p>He awoke and thinking that the cadet sleeping in the upper bunk had wet the bed, he jumped up and immediately accosted the</p>

<p>unsuspecting comrade from a sound stupor. Of course, a fight ensued, bringing much satisfaction to the pranksters. The disturbance</p>

<p>could not have failed to catch the attention of the sergeant who quickly restored order and discipline.</p>

<p>One comrade whom he met in the army was Julius Ingelfinger. The two became friends. They were stationed together at</p>

<p>the barracks at Weingarten im Wald ,8  perhaps even at the Lazarett Garrison9  or military hospital there. Julius also either was married to</p>

<p>or had a sister named Rosemari. She, too, became a friend. They all exchanged postcards with Joseph from time to time. Also, Theo</p>

<p>Ingefinger, obviously a brother, also was included in this circle of friends with whom Joseph kept in touch through postcards10  and</p>

<p>letters. Perhaps they began a correspondence after their basic training or when they were stationed together. Joseph and the</p>

<p>Ingelfingers exchange of postcards and letters may have lasted at least for three years between April 1910 and July 1913, according to</p>

<p>number of postcards that have survived. Then their correspondence ended, suddenly and without additional explanation. Either</p>

<p>Joseph’s immigration to America or the war ended it. Joseph never revealed what happened to the Ingefingers, or he may simply not</p>

<p>have known. The Ingelfingers faded into Joseph’s memory as everything else from the old world.</p>

<p>While most of the postcards touched only on routine things that may have been of interest at the time, there may have been</p>

<p>letters as well. There are hints that there were. In the postcards that survived, there was mostly small talk, the kind in which one just</p>

<p>means to say, “I am thinking of you,” etc. There were comments about new locations where Ingefinger was obviously stationed,</p>

<p>activities, employment, etc. They wrote about things that they thought the other might like to know: what they saw and what they</p>

<p>were doing, new cities, different countries and different customs, new places to see, new things to do. Or how new jobs were working</p>

<p>out.</p>

<p>“I have a good position here,”  Julius once wrote, “and making tons. I’ll have to make a huge deposit soon at the bank.” – “Did</p>

<p>you finish that giant walk fest?” – “How is your work progressing? Living here is simply beautiful – even more beautiful than Lake</p>

<p>Constance.” – “I am having a blast learning how to fly right now.” - “Thank you for your kind words and you must have known that</p>

<p>the planned excursion would be delayed for a week.” 11</p>

<p>The following postcard hinted at date by which Joseph was no longer either required to wear his uniform: that is, he had</p>

<p>fulfilled his obligation to the German Army or he had resigned by April 1910. It clearly places Joseph, at the age of 21, in</p>

<p>Langenargen, Germany working for Bass and Keller , a vinegar factory that was located there.</p>

<p>My Dear Comrade!</p>

<p>I was thrilled to receive a card from you and read it with great joy. Amazing that you have returned to</p>

<p>wearing civilian clothes! I wish you much luck in your new endeavor. I will stay in a little longer and then</p>

<p>come to visit. I’ll write you ahead of time.</p>

<p>Another friend’s postcard might provide convincing proof that Joseph had completed his tour of duty in the reserves. A</p>

<p>Max Sturm, obviously another comrade with whom Joseph had served, indicated that his tour would not end for another six months.</p>

<p>Max wrote to Joseph at the Lazarett Garrison in Weingarten im Wald a month earlier. Within a month after receiving the following</p>

<p>postcard, Joseph was out of uniform and employed as a correspondent at Bass &amp; Keller. However, as all reservists, he could have</p>

<p>been called up for reserve training, something of which Joseph complained later.</p>

<p>Weingarten im Wald</p>

<p>I have received your card with its warm greetings. I am always doing well. I will finally complete my damned long</p>

<p>service of 182 days on the 16th. On the 19th, if all goes well, we will be off. In any event on Easter I will not be on</p>

<p>vacation. Staying a week with Joseph Schädler16 does not suit me any more either as it is more comfortable, as soldiers,</p>

<p>to stay in our own barracks.</p>

<p>Greetings to all!</p>

<p>Max Sturm</p>

<p>According to Joseph, he was required to participate in periodic maneuvers from time to time which he claimed took him</p>

<p>away from his employment and caused him difficulty in trying to further his career, for there seemed to be no end to the number of</p>

<p>times he was being required to participate.17 This would be one of his excuses he stated for leaving Germany. However, it is</p>

<p>doubtful that he was still required to perform duties as a reservist by 1914, and he definitely did not desert the German Army,</p>

<p>something to which he later alluded although the reasons for that are not understood.18 Consequently, following his basic training</p>

<p>believed to have been completed by the end of January 1907, he was free to enroll in courses at the university level, provided, of</p>

<p>course, that he would participate in reserve training from time to time. It would appear that his reserve training interrupted more of</p>

<p>his continuing education than his employment. Assuming that he entered the reserves upon completion of his Gymnasium at</p>

<p>Radolfzell, he completed his basics and then entered Kirchheim under Tech, his choice for study for the next 18 months. He was still</p>

<p>participating in the reserve training for the first months of his employment at Bass &amp; Keller.</p>

<p>Joseph chose to pursue a study of business, albeit an elementary one. As mentioned before, Germany was the undisputed</p>

<p>leader in industrialization by the turn of the 20th century. As Germany entered the twentieth century the world’s business leadership</p>

<p>was claimed by Germany as well. At first glance one might have expected Great Britain and its unmatched tradition of great</p>

<p>economists to take this lead, but Great Britain’s leading economists and other scholars had a great distaste for commerce and</p>

<p>accounting. It was, as some described later, as if they did not wish to dirty their hands with pencils and erasers. Consequently,</p>

<p>Germany took this title as well. German economists combined a sound and practical sense of business with the gift to apply this in a</p>

<p>logical and scientific fashion to the needs of an ever-increasing industrialization and commerce. By 1910 no less than nine advanced</p>

<p>schools in economics had been founded in Germany; one in Mannheim (1908) was near to where Joseph lived.19 This is not to imply</p>

<p>that Joseph was interested in pursuing a career in accounting, but to point out that accounting and new business practices were very</p>

<p>much in the news at this time. To someone as well-read as Joseph, Germany’s leadership in business accounting nor the gradual</p>

<p>movement toward socialism in Germany would not have gone unnoticed. Joseph, of course, had spurned the ideal of an agrarian</p>

<p>education for one he felt was more practical in a business world.</p>

<p>According to Joseph’s resume submitted to the American Secretary of State, Joseph claimed to have studied in the city of</p>

<p>Kirchheim under Teck20 from approximately February 1907 to July 1908. One has to assume that Wendelin made this possible, for</p>

<p>no other source of financing was available from family or friends. It is, however, unlikely to locate the school that Joseph may have</p>

<p>attended at that time, but there are a number of schools in the vicinity and Joseph may have simply chosen, as he did with Constance,</p>

<p>to name a more prominent city such as Kirchheim under Teck that was located nearby. However, it would appear that Stuttgart</p>

<p>would have been a more logical city with which to identify, for it was not far away. The entire length of time he was enrolled there</p>

<p>was only 16 or 17 months, surely not enough time to delve deep into the principles of accounting other than receiving a fundamental</p>

<p>training in business and bookkeeping. Of course, none of the socialist theories of economics were then being discussed at the</p>

<p>university levels. Whatever courses and whatever certification he received during this period, it was sufficient to win employment by</p>

<p>August 1908 in a business located in the town of Langenargen, a beautiful lakeside town on Lake Constance. At last he was on his</p>

<p>own and not far from Volkertshausen should he wish to visit there. He had only a few years to go in completing his obligation to the</p>

<p>nearby 101st Bavarian Infantry Reserves at which time he would be completely free. He was finally set to reap the benefit of years of</p>

<p>study, put his foreign language skills to work, and enter the world of business.</p>

<p>Bass &amp; Keller was a firm that produced vinegar and brandy in the town of Langenargen, Germany. It was located on Lake</p>

<p>Constance, and today is about an hour’s drive from Volkertshausen. Joseph found employment there in 1908 and lived at house</p>

<p>Number 100e.21 Bass &amp; Keller was founded as a vinegar factory around 1862. In 1894 it was sold to a larger manufacture with a</p>

<p>plant and some offices elsewhere, but the name was not changed. On many occasions, Joseph often described the process for</p>

<p>making vinegar and how vinegar was transferred overhead through glass pipes from vats to bottling. How he found employment at</p>

<p>Bass and Keller or how they found him no one will ever know. He obviously interviewed for a position and was accepted. The</p>

<p>company offered him a starting position of “Shipping Clerk” and a company room, a place to live. Bass &amp; Keller was a well-known</p>

<p>and respected manufacture throughout the region. It obviously was quite successful and had grown to a sizable company, albeit now</p>

<p>a branch of a larger firm by the time Joseph went to work there.</p>

<p>Joseph worked at his new position for a year. His duties, among others, certainly included preparing product for shipping.</p>

<p>That may not have been what he expected, but then he was not afraid of doing manual labor. As in many companies, Bass &amp; Keller</p>

<p>very likely thought that all new employees should start at the bottom. The town was served by rail, so much of their product left</p>

<p>Langenargen aboard freight cars. Vinegar was produced in a number of different sized containers, and Joseph’s task was to keep</p>

<p>accurate records on quantities, customer orders, and shipping.</p>

<p>55</p>

<p>22</p>

<p>Bass &amp; Keller, Langenargen, Germany - ca 1908</p>

<p>In August 1909 he was promoted to being a correspondent for the firm, very likely more of desk job than before. It was his</p>

<p>first promotion. He had to have felt good about that. He was proving that others appreciated his work performance. He was</p>

<p>working his way up. Bass &amp; Keller, as all large companies, received large quantities of mail. Joseph’s tasks were to answer letters and</p>

<p>inquire and perhaps gather information on various vinegars available for shipping and export. Joseph demonstrated a lot of natural</p>

<p>talent in drafting responses. This training, this attention to detail, helped him later when, as an attorney, he argued cases in court. He</p>

<p>was putting more of his training to practical use and took on more responsibilities, such as paying bills and handling accounts</p>

<p>payables and even receivables for Bass &amp; Keller.</p>

<p>23</p>

<p>Building No. 4 Bass und Keller, Langenargen, Germany – 2007</p>

<p>Upon his second anniversary with the firm, Joseph was promoted to that of cashier for the firm. He was responsible for</p>

<p>moneys, billings, and general financials for the firm. Joseph now had additional responsibilities and duties. Cashiers collected</p>

<p>payments for the goods Bass &amp; Keller sold and paid bills. Now, at last, he was doing real bookkeeping. As all bookkeepers, Joseph</p>

<p>had to balance the books and keep them accurately. He kept such detailed accounting books for himself, complete with balance</p>

<p>sheets and year-end reports, after he arrived in Fredericksburg in 1917. He obviously did a good job for Bass &amp; Keller, for he worked</p>

<p>at that position for another two years before deciding to move to Stuttgart to a new assignment at the end of 1912. Leaving his</p>

<p>beloved Lake Constance had to have been difficult, for the Bodensee24  had been a part of his life for a long time. It made the move to</p>

<p>Stuttgart somewhat puzzling.</p>

<p>There was nothing special about Langenargen, but there were a few significant sights for tourists to see: a rather nice and</p>

<p>spacious public square, a beautiful Catholic church which Joseph definitely attended for Mass, and a royal residence, Castel Montfort.</p>

<p>Langenargen was, in reality, only part of a greater whole, the Lake Constance (Bodensee ). From the shores along Langenargen, one can</p>

<p>easily see the Swiss shoreline to the west and the snowcapped Alps to the south. This has led to Langenargen being called “The</p>

<p>Sunroom of the Bodensee.” The city, as all lakeshore cities and towns, had its share of sidewalk cafes and wine cafes along the</p>

<p>56</p>

<p>lakeshore and its coffee houses. Of course, only Langenargen had Castel Montfort,25  built in a distinct Moorish style. It served as the</p>

<p>city’s landmark. Along the shore, summer concerts were held and many sports clubs abounded. Sailing was very popular and here</p>

<p>Joseph fell in love with the Bodensee  and its boats.26  Of course, he had lived near its shores for years, at least since 1900, when he</p>

<p>began attending school in Radolfzell. Now he was a grown-up. There were new places of interests. Now he could sail and explore</p>

<p>the entire lake. Now he could sit conversing for endless hours in the cafes and restaurants that dotted the area. There he could</p>

<p>explore other castles if he so chose or sit for hours just talking to newfound friends. Joseph was becoming known as an interesting</p>

<p>and knowledgeable friend with whom to have an intelligent conversation.</p>

<p>Nearby were many other small towns and those who lived in Langenargen often ventured to them on foot or by bicycle.</p>

<p>Most were accessible simply by walking. Joseph and his friends hiked often and, of course, there was always a train to take them if</p>

<p>they wanted to go even farther and ferries should they have decided to travel over to Switzerland. This was not an isolated region of</p>

<p>Germany. It was a bustling center for commerce and tourism. Lake Constance drew thousands of affluent and now not so affluent</p>

<p>visitors to its shores. It was a perfect place to meet new friends. A short boat ride across the lake brought Joseph and his friends to</p>

<p>the Island of Maniau27  with its tropical flowers and beautiful gardens that offered an afternoon or whole day of picnicking and hiking.</p>

<p>A direct ferry crossed to Constance, the biggest city on the lake, a little south of Radolfzell, where its inhabitants practically moved</p>

<p>out-of-doors as soon as temperatures allowed. Germans had always had a great appreciation for being out-of-doors, especially after</p>

<p>enduring long and cold winters. Here, life was truly lived outside among street cafes, along the lake, and in the parks. Its winding</p>

<p>lanes of the Niederburg28  are the oldest part of Konstanz and the liveliest. Here Joseph, among friends, enjoyed the wine bars and</p>

<p>trendy drinking places,29  so different from what he had grown up with in Volkertshausen and certainly very different than his father’s</p>

<p>Gasthaus zum Löwen. Here he could easily forget the misery being suffered by his mother at the Gastehaus zum Löwen and the</p>

<p>tyranny being daily dealt by Wendelin. Here he could forget all that he had endured growing up under his father’s thumb. Here he</p>

<p>was on his own. He had studied hard to get here, and in Langenargen he discovered that there was life outside Volkertshausen and</p>

<p>that it could be good. Here he could block out the problems at home and although he gave advice to his mother as to what she</p>

<p>should do, he could do no more. The initiative had to come from Maria, and if she was not up to it, there was nothing more that he</p>

<p>could do. He could only grow impatient with her constant procrastinating and indecision. Here he could forget those problems.</p>

<p>A little farther down the eastern shoreline was Friedrichshafen where the famous German airships were invented.30  These</p>

<p>giant airships caught the attention of Joseph as they often flew over Langenargen on their way to Stuttgart or other major cities to the</p>

<p>north or when newer experimental ships were taken out over the lake for their maiden flights. In complete silence, their huge silver</p>

<p>canvas covered frames arose in the skies in the horizon just to the north of Langenargen and must have made spectacular sights as</p>

<p>their engines seem to push them seemingly effortlessly ever closer over Langenargen and other cities around the Lake Constance. As</p>

<p>they approached a town, the first sounds of their engines caught the attention of its citizens. Who among them could not resist</p>

<p>stopping to watch as they passed directly overhead on their way somewhere charting a new future for flight? If Joseph could push</p>

<p>aside his problems at home, he could marvel at the magnificent age of engineering that Germany was creating. The future here on</p>

<p>the lake looked bright for the young graduate beginning his career at Bass &amp; Keller.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the obvious, the lake itself and the glacial waters that made the lake so interesting, so naturally pure. The</p>

<p>Bodensee  is situated at the northern foot of the Alps and straddles two other countries, Switzerland and Austria. It is a unique world</p>

<p>unto itself, a region that is captivating in that it draws people to return often to enjoy its beauty, its charm, and much warmer climate.</p>

<p>First recorded in written history by the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela31  about AD 43, it captivated all who passed by it. The</p>

<p>Bodensee  measures only 40 miles long and up to 9 miles wide. It is deep; at 819 feet, it could hide all but three feet of the new British</p>

<p>Liner Titanic  if stood on its end.32  It was gouged by a series of seemingly endless glaciers until its depths captured the melted waters.</p>

<p>Those that it could not hold formed and fed the Rhine River on its way to the North Sea. The lake was a sailor’s dream, and at the</p>

<p>time Joseph lived in Langenargen, numerous steam-powered boats glided silently and almost effortlessly as they ferried people</p>

<p>smoothly across the mirrored surface waters of the lake to various ports of call. Only the occasional steam whistle and bells</p>

<p>resonated across the waters of the lake. Regular ferry service was well-established at the time Joseph lived here, and it provided him</p>

<p>with an inexpensive transportation to and from a city that he knew quite well from his days in Radolfzell, Constance. Along its</p>

<p>shores sped frequent passenger and freight trains demonstrating the economic importance of the lake and the region itself.</p>

<p>33</p>

<p>Lakeside scene along the shores of the Bodensee ca 1910</p>

<p>57</p>

<p>Joseph also learned tales and had stories to tell of the life around the lake, stories that were repeated, often embellished, but</p>

<p>continued to astound those unfamiliar with the lake. One year, it was reported, the lake froze entirely over during a bitterly cold,</p>

<p>wintery blizzard that blew in from the heights of the Alps to the south.34  A stranger, bedecked with snow, lost his way in the dark of</p>

<p>night before finally stumbling through a door of an inn. There he announced to the astonished guests that he had lost his way and</p>

<p>walked what seemed like endless hours trying to find some warm place to get out of the blowing snow and cold. Now he asked</p>

<p>where he might be, for he did not recognize this inn or these people. When told, he quickly realized that he had walked across the</p>

<p>frozen waters of the lake from Switzerland to the German side. Upon hearing that and realizing its implications, he went into shock</p>

<p>and died from fright on the spot.</p>

<p>The lake was also perfect for sailing, and for a farm boy in land-locked Volkertshausen, his stint in Radolfzell had brought</p>

<p>him into contact with water. Sailing and sailboats fascinated him only to the point of wanting to sail. Now, at last, employed and</p>

<p>earning money, he had access to boats and the possibility of sailing. On beautiful sun-drenched days the lake soon became covered</p>

<p>with an endless sea of sails as the sun-worshiping locals and visitors took to the water to experience a thrill that was impossible to</p>

<p>replicate on land. Joseph fell in love with sailing and vowed one day to have his own boat even if it meant he had to build it himself.</p>

<p>Joseph later also had stories to tell about the first inhabitants of the area, the people who built their houses and entire</p>

<p>villages on stilts for protection. Joseph described these huts of Lake Constance’s earliest inhabitants many times in his after-dinner</p>

<p>tales. The first inhabitants along the lake shores were dwellers of the Stone and Bronze Ages (4,000 to 850 BC).35  He described in</p>

<p>detail seeing the remnants of the original posts still clearly visible under the shallow waters along the shores where examples of these</p>

<p>dwellings had already by 1910 been restored.36  These people lived much like other stone-aged people around the world, and their</p>

<p>descendants were the first to encounter the advancing Romans as they marched ever northward to expand their empire. The Bodensee</p>

<p>became the port of entry into Germany from the south, especially as they followed the Rhine River northward deep into the heart of</p>

<p>Germany.</p>

<p>37</p>

<p>The Lake Dwellings of the Stone and Bronze Age (4.000 to 850 BC) at Lake</p>

<p>The shores of Lake Constance were only a stone’s throw from Joseph’s work and quarters at Bass &amp; Keller. He could see</p>

<p>its smooth waters at any time of the day or night. The sounds and smells associated with a bustling and vibrant Germany were as real</p>

<p>as those found along Germany’s northern coasts. Fisherman brought their early morning catch to restaurants and fish markets</p>

<p>regularly as they still do today. Sea gulls, hungry for scraps, were as common here as at any seaside. The sounds of boat horns, bells,</p>

<p>whistles, and even fog horns resonated across the still waters of the lake, carried seemingly from one distant shoreline to the other by</p>

<p>the crisp mountain air at intervals throughout the day and night as if they were only feet away from one. The waters of The Bodensee</p>

<p>brought serenity to those who lived along its shores and perhaps served to offer Joseph some comfort to escape from his family as he</p>

<p>sailed its waters, learned to float for hours on end on his back, and participated in comradeship in the cafes and restaurants along its</p>

<p>shores as if he had no other worries. Its waters brought him the serenity that he craved as would such waters in America one day.</p>

<p>Clearly, the Bodensee  was Joseph’s favorite area. He had grown up along its shores. Radolfzell, where he attended school</p>

<p>from the age of 12, lay on its northern shores. He could reach its smoothing shores in only a minute’s walk. The milder microclimates</p>

<p>along the shores of the lake permitted the growing of fruits that were impossible to grow just a few dozen miles farther</p>

<p>inland. Here vacationers flocked to swim, sail, and enjoy the Gemüdlichkeit38  that only Germany can offer. That had not happened</p>

<p>in the small farming village of Volkertshausen. The area here abounded with dozens of inviting cafes, hotels, and restaurants</p>

<p>scattered along its shores that invited time to stand still and encouraged good talk among friends. Joseph could not have failed to</p>

<p>notice that life in Radolfzell was quite different than that of Volkertshausen. There was more to life than working hard on a farm.</p>

<p>58</p>

<p>Agriculture grew to be less of an option as he continued his studies in Radolfzell. Between towns there seemed to be an endless</p>

<p>number of vibrant farms producing grapes, apples, peaches, plums, hay for cattle and horses, sheep grazing the rolling hills, and</p>

<p>beautifully cared for farmhouses, quite unlike the Buhlhof, which eked out a bare existence and offered no relief from the daily</p>

<p>struggle to feed and clothe a growing family. Nor did these farms seem as dreary as the mundane routines demanded by Wendelin</p>

<p>for his little farm. Here the daily markets abounded with produce and products freshly grown on area farms and filled the morning</p>

<p>air with an unforgettable aroma of freshness. The lake abounded an air of an appreciation for life and that hard work rewarded.</p>

<p>Joseph knew that he was not going to return to Volkertshausen.</p>

<p>The seasonal influx of tourist and vacationers at Langenargen presented Joseph’s circle of friends with a steady and constant</p>

<p>ability to encounter new friends, for Germans who could afford it had not only always enjoyed traveling and seeing their own</p>

<p>country, but also Germany’s economic boom now made it possible for more and more of her people to travel and to have leisure</p>

<p>time. A new, younger set also began to travel and vacation along its shores. Even Langenargen, perhaps not as attractive as other</p>

<p>area towns, attracted its share of these travelers. Joseph could not have chosen a more popular area to find employment. If he had</p>

<p>other job offers in 1908, we will never know, of course, but he may have chosen to be employed in Langenargen at least for now</p>

<p>because of its charm.39  The area was perfect for any young man seeking to settle down and eventually rear a family. What young</p>

<p>man didn’t have thoughts of that? Perhaps, because of his experiences endured at Volkertshausen, he might have been hesitant to</p>

<p>become involved, but here in Langenargen, among the calming influence of the Bodensee , he lived in a world apart from all pasts, pasts</p>

<p>that were for him best forgotten, including the pleas of his mother. Joseph grew more indifferent and expanded his circle of friends,</p>

<p>friends that now included a number of women.</p>

<p>There is nothing to conclude that Joseph’s friendship with Maria Bayer was anything other than friendship, and she may</p>

<p>have been one of many, for there certainly were others with whom Joseph took time to correspond. Maria Bayer may also have</p>

<p>brought her own circle of friends to vacation with her in Langenargen. Joseph may have stumbled into this circle by chance or by</p>

<p>invitation. How, we will never know, of course, but Joseph did increase his circle of friends. The number of outdoor cafes and</p>

<p>restaurants, even in Langenargen, certainly provided much opportunity for strangers to meet. Joseph had studied hard for years to</p>

<p>get his education. Now he was approaching the age of 22 and seeking a wife had to be a prime objective at some point.</p>

<p>Joseph, despite having been reared in a rather rural setting, had become a young gentleman of fashion. Not only was</p>

<p>education a qualification to success, but also how one presented himself was also important. Whether as a shipping clerk,</p>

<p>correspondent, or cashier for a large firm, appearance was everything. Joseph wore what was typical of the day: clothes of distinction</p>

<p>as the times dictated for any man whose goal was to advance himself. He began sporting a Van Dyke. His wardrobe grew to include</p>

<p>a woolen topcoat and silk pop-up top hat. He wore the stiff collars, then so fashionable and popular. He had gold cufflinks for his</p>

<p>shirts. He presented an image of a well-dressed gentleman entering the second decade of the twentieth century. Perhaps it was his</p>

<p>dapper appearances that led some women to want to get to meet him. He became an excellent dancer, he was knowledgeable on any</p>

<p>topic, and he was charming when he wanted to be. He should have been quite a catch for any woman.</p>

<p>Maria Bayer</p>

<p>One such female friend was Maria Bayer, a native from Stuttgart, who apparently vacationed in Langenargen where, by</p>

<p>chance, she met Joseph. She wrote him and he wrote to her, but she refers to him only as “Mr. Wieser.” The surviving</p>

<p>correspondence only covers the last quarter of 1910 and by January 1911, any romance, if there ever was anything between them, in</p>

<p>all likelihood was over. Still, there are doubts. One unmailed postcard from Joseph also survived and a reference in a rare revelation</p>

<p>by Joseph in a letter to Anna hints that there may have been more to Maria Bayer or another for whom Joseph felt romantically</p>

<p>inclined. He would recall a lost Easter weekend many years later in a letter to his sister, Anna. It must have hurt him deeply, but he</p>

<p>never came close to admitting it except for this single reference. Either she or some other female may have been the reason for his</p>

<p>eagerness to immigrate: to put his hurt behind him, to seek a new life, and to devote his life to the pursuit of financial freedom.</p>

<p>Vincent’s chance trip to Volkertshausen that August 1910 may have presented an opportunity and excuse he now wished to exercise.</p>

<p>He had procrastinated for almost four years, but after 1913 and his move to Stuttgart, he had nothing to hold him in Europe.</p>

<p>Stuttgart - Schlossplatz</p>

<p>1 Nov 1910</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Wieser!</p>

<p>Just another card to wish you well as I have decided to stay home today in all this bad weather. Even last</p>

<p>Sunday we could not make any plans to travel since it was raining then as well. I am supposed to give you greetings</p>

<p>from L. M. and Luise.</p>

<p>Best Wishes! Maria Beyer</p>

<p>60</p>

<p>Then, a week after received the one above, Joseph began to write the following postcard. He stopped in mid-sentence as if</p>

<p>interrupted or could not find the words to continue writing. Something had happened. Perhaps it was related to that Easter weekend</p>

<p>of which he wrote to Anna decades later. But, Easter is in the spring and this was in November. Perhaps he kept her postcards</p>

<p>simply as a reminder of what might have been. It and all others remained part of the collection he kept in an old cigar box on the top</p>

<p>shelf of his Kleiderschrank .41  How often he took them out to look at a past that was a secret to all but him is not known. The simple</p>

<p>fact they occupied a prominent spot in his closet to the end of his life might speak volumes in itself. Joseph did not convey the</p>

<p>importance of these to anyone.</p>

<p>May I buy you a glass of wine next Saturday evening at 8:30 at the Ship?</p>

<p>Many greetings,</p>

<p>Kristina</p>

<p>If there was additional contact between Joseph and Maria following the end of 1910, there is no written evidence to be</p>

<p>found. Six months later he was corresponding with another woman, a Nathanliee Fliess and her friend, Kristina. Kristina even</p>

<p>suggested that they meet the next time she was in town. The correspondence that has survived covered only about six months;</p>

<p>perhaps it was hardly sufficient time for a romance to seriously develop into a relationship. If there were letters, he undoubtedly</p>

<p>disposed of them as he did with all others. No letters or cards were apparently exchanged with Maria Bayer during this time, which</p>

<p>indicates that that friendship was over for good and was of little importance.</p>

<p>A large number of postcards may have been destroyed by Joseph before departing Germany or after bringing them to</p>

<p>America. Is it coincidental that none survived after 1913? In 1912 Joseph left the Langenargen and the Lake Constance area to move</p>

<p>to Stuttgart. Julius Ingelfinger apparently did not get word of his moving, for he continued to send at least two to his old</p>

<p>Langenargen address. By that time, if the dates of those postcards that have survived can be taken as a guide, correspondence</p>

<p>between them had slowed to that of a postcard every 9 months or so. That Joseph had moved to Stuttgart was never mentioned by</p>

<p>Joseph and was only discovered when the United States Archives made copies of his application for employment available in 2009.</p>

<p>In that application Joseph stated that he had been employed by a firm there in 1912. Incidentally, Stuttgart was also the home of</p>

<p>Maria Bayer. Whether he bothered to look her up or make contact can now only be a guess. Not a scrap of correspondence remains</p>

<p>from this period. The fact that neither his sister Anna or anyone else ever mentioned that Joseph had lived and worked in Stuttgart is</p>

<p>also puzzling. And, it may well be that he destroyed all correspondence directed to him there as if to erase those years entirely.</p>

<p>Miss Maria Bayer</p>

<p>Alleenstrasse 36</p>

<p>Stuttgart</p>

<p>My dear Woman!</p>

<p>Many thanks for your lovely little letter. I was saddened to learn…</p>

<p>Wendelin continued to oppose allowing Joseph to enter into his business in Volkertshausen. He did not wish for him to</p>

<p>be involved in his inn, his farm, or the sale of farming equipment and household appliances. Wendelin may have felt that he had paid</p>

<p>enough for his oldest son’s education. He wanted nothing to do with him. Why Joseph would want to be in business with his father</p>

<p>after all these difficult and trying years is another mystery that is now impossible to determine. The larger mystery is why Joseph</p>

<p>would want to be involved in business with his father. The simple truth was that it was not going to happen. In 1912 Joseph</p>

<p>accepted employment away from Lake Constance, and that can be only because he considered it an advancement, if not a transfer.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was all part of his career plan. Joseph would start at a small factory and then work his way up to one in a larger</p>

<p>city. Just as college graduates hope to move up to bigger and better employment, perhaps that is what he was trying to do in 1912.</p>

<p>In Stuttgart he found employment with another vinegar factory, Hirsch &amp; Lichter, owned by two Jewish families. Hirsch &amp; Lichter</p>

<p>was actually located in a village then about 5 ó miles west of the city of Stuttgart.44  Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing</p>

<p>concrete regarding his last two years in Germany save for what can be read into his application, for it also indicated that he accepted</p>

<p>work as a sales representative covering an area of Austria and Italy, but not much more can be deduced from these meager references.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is quite clear that he had left his heart on Lake Constance.</p>

<p>In 1912 Joseph moved from his beloved Lake Constance. Joseph’s move to Stuttgart, whether to pursue Maria Bayer or to</p>

<p>advance his career, had the appearance of being a major mistake. He never mentioned living there; for two years of his life, there is</p>

<p>nothing of record: no letter, no postcard, nothing that might be construed as proof that this was so. What is certainly obvious was</p>

<p>that after some months of reflection, he began to contemplate and formulate a solution to his unhappiness. Uncle Vincent’s offer</p>

<p>seemed to become more attractive with each passing month.</p>

<p>In the same year the full viciousness and evil of his father was brought down on Maria and her family. Wendelin devastated</p>

<p>Maria for having left him. Without warning and while Marie procrastinated, he sold everything out from under her and abandoned</p>

<p>not only Maria, but also his daughter Anna and his youngest son Ernst. Returning to gather some clothes, Anna discovered that she</p>

<p>62</p>

<p>was locked out of her former home. Anna could collect only what she could physically carry back to the attic apartment she had</p>

<p>found in Tuttlingen.</p>

<p>Of course, Joseph had been warning his mother for years that she should file for divorce. She had spurned his advice much</p>

<p>to his disapproval. Had she simply filed, she would have been able to prevent Wendelin from selling. Now, she had nothing, and he</p>

<p>had all the cash and was living in another country. There was nothing that Joseph could do for her. Besides being resentful that his</p>

<p>mother had not listened to him, Joseph did what he had a tendency to do to those who did not listen and that was to cease all advice,</p>

<p>sever all contact, and remain silent and indifferent to pleas for help. He had his own future to live, for he was employed now in a</p>

<p>new city. He could not be expected to drop everything and come to her aid. What could he do for her now? The house and the</p>

<p>Gasthaus zum Löwen  were sold as well as their home, the farm, all the equipment, inventory, and whatever savings there might have</p>

<p>been. Gone! So was Wendelin!</p>

<p>Anna, Ernst, and their mother could not come to Stuttgart to live with him. They would simply have to make the best of it.</p>

<p>It cannot be determined if he offered advice to Anna or not. Anna, from the age of fifteen, simply began to make the decisions for</p>

<p>their mother and brother. Surely, a relative would take them in. He could not be bothered with details. His standard solution to</p>

<p>problems was always to flee to the country. Volkertshausen was not exactly a city. Farms such as the Buhlhof and Gerifhof were</p>

<p>definitely considered to be in the country, buy only the Buhlhof was self-sufficient. Nor can it be confirmed that he ever sent money.</p>

<p>In many respects he may have been as lost as they. He would find a solution for his problems. They needed to do the same.</p>

<p>Sometime in 1913, Joseph now began to consider accepting the invitation so generously offered by Vincent in August of</p>

<p>\1910. He and Vincent had exchanged letters off and on since Vincent’s visit. However, only one postcard survived that was written</p>

<p>to Joseph. Joseph, of course, kept none. If his move to Stuttgart did not advance his career at some point, he would begin to explore</p>

<p>the options offered by Vincent. It was all a dream, of course, Vincent’s mills, banks, and power companies. What did Joseph hope to</p>

<p>accomplish in Texas other than being a bookkeeper for one of Vincent’s businesses. Was there hope that he would find a real family?</p>

<p>Perhaps he would find a family that honored its members without vengeance as a motive?</p>

<p>Immigrating to the United States presented problems for Joseph, for in all his studies and preparations, he had not learned</p>

<p>to speak English! He had studied Italian, Spanish and French, but not English. Consequently, immigrating to America had never</p>

<p>been on his mind as he had enrolled in all those courses. It is likely that he did not consider immigrating until some time after his</p>

<p>move to Stuttgart, for if he had such thoughts upon moving to America, he would have immediately begun to prepare himself by</p>

<p>taking some courses in English. The decision had to be made late in 1913 when there was basically no time left for preparations.</p>

<p>However, what was he to expect? He had done nothing in Germany that prepared him for Texas. He was placing his</p>

<p>future into the hands of a relative with whom he had had the chance to visit only briefly during that month Vincent was in Europe.</p>

<p>Texas in 1914 could be a land of opportunity for him. He might be able to be of some service to Vincent in the running of his flour</p>

<p>and feed mills. Vincent certainly had a much larger operation than that of Bass &amp; Keller. It could mean a successful career, moving</p>

<p>up in company, having a family that extruded the kind of success that Joseph admired and that came from hard work. It might be</p>

<p>everything for which he had dreamed. There in Texas was a family that was working together. His own father had refused his offer</p>

<p>to go into business together. What other option lay ahead for him other than remaining in Germany? What was he prepared to do?</p>

<p>He had no savings, despite six years at work. How could he ever save enough to begin his own business? How much longer would</p>

<p>he be satisfied to simply work for others?</p>

<p>Additionally, Texas, having been a part of the Confederacy, was tied to the other southern states and consequently still</p>

<p>lagged far behind the other states of the union. That might mean more opportunity or more difficulties. The northern states offered</p>

<p>better opportunities but more competition, and, of course, there were no family connections that could help. Joseph’s younger</p>

<p>brother, would discover this when he eventually immigrated to New York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Joseph’s ability to speak some French and Italian was useless to him in Texas, and his Spanish, even he</p>

<p>admitted, was questionable. Not speaking English proved to be a distinct handicap. Fortunately, these were handicaps that he knew</p>

<p>he could overcome with time. What he did not expect and could not overcome was the jealousy of Vincent’s sons and daughters.</p>

<p>They had not accompanied Vincent to Germany. Of course, Vincent revealed no difficulty with his family when he visited</p>

<p>Volkertshausen. Joseph could not have known that Vincent’s children harbored such feeling. Moreover, there was no reason to</p>

<p>suspect such behavior. Vincent’s children did not, however, share their father’s enthusiasm for this brash young Joseph, nor did they</p>

<p>care for their father’s obvious affection for him. Joseph might even have been considered as a threat to them. He proved to be</p>

<p>smarter, brighter, and more ambitious. Joseph eventually described them as simply being “spoiled.”</p>

<p>Additionally, we have no way of knowing how genuine Vincent’s offer had been. Had it been just something that had been</p>

<p>offered to be polite, or was Vincent genuine? Did Vincent, at 73 really want to take a distinct cousin under his tutelage with whom he</p>

<p>had had only brief contact? What did Vincent see in Joseph that made Joseph different from Wendelin? Or did Wendelin make an</p>

<p>offer to Vincent to take Joseph off his hands? Finally, because of Vincent’s advanced age, there was the question as to how much he</p>

<p>was still in control of the family’s businesses. After all, he and his sons operated a mega company by Texas standards. Joseph, in</p>

<p>another after-dinner tale, often related that each of the sons inherited a million dollars in cash and at least one of the mills upon</p>

<p>Vincent’s death, but each lost everything in time. According to Joseph, the children of Vincent were spoiled and simply did not</p>

<p>understand the businesses that Vincent had put together. However, Vincent had been in business with his sons since moving to</p>

<p>Texas, and together they had built a very successful enterprise consisting of many other investments than agricultural related. It is</p>

<p>more likely that they were victims of a new progressive movement that under President Wilson led to government involvement in</p>

<p>areas in which governmental officials knew nothing about making sales and sustaining customers. The economy may well have done</p>

<p>them in. Joseph’s tales always had a moral to them and this one, of course, was to keep working hard and to appreciate what others</p>

<p>had done for you.</p>

<p>63</p>

<p>Nevertheless, at some point Joseph decided to cast his fate into the hands of Vincent, a man whose success was clearly the</p>

<p>result of hard work. Joseph wanted to live the American dream just as Uncle Vincent had done. Perhaps there he could get ahead.</p>

<p>Perhaps one day he would return to Volkertshausen as Vincent had done in 1910 as an example of what comes to those who work</p>

<p>hard, who save their earnings, and who make something of themselves. That would show those there that not all Wiesers were like</p>

<p>Wendelin.</p>

<p>and frequently unexpected call up of the reserves. He would claim that these untimely and unpredictable training demands interfered</p>

      <p>The 101st Infantry Division served on the Eastern Front, seeing its first action in the Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. It crossed the Dnestr in June 1915, participated in the battles on the Galician and Russian Poland border, and advanced to the Bug by August. The division was then transferred south to participate in the Serbian Campaign. It reached Priština in late November and advanced to the Greek border in December. For most of 1916 and into 1917, the division remained on the Macedonian front. It underwent several changes, losing units to other divisions and receiving various replacements, and in July 1917, the division was dissolved as a tactical headquarters, with its subunits sent to other units. Its headquarters remained as a division staff for special purposes, administering Bulgarian units, until it was dissolved. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Infantry_Division_ (German_Empire) – accessed June 5, 2010. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
