<h2 id="uncle-vincents-triumphant-homecoming">Uncle Vincent’s Triumphant Homecoming</h2>

<p>In 1910 a letter arrived at the Gasthaus zum Löwen in Volkertshausen, perhaps delivered by the postmaster, for it could not have
been addressed to Wendelin. Wendelin only had the inn for a year. It had been very likely simply addressed to the mayor hoping that
he would deliver it to anyone named Wieser. Upon opening, it revealed that some relative in America was seeking to make contact
with long lost relatives in Volkertshausen. Wendelin Wieser learned that he was going to be receiving a visitor from America, a first
cousin whom he had never met, for his father’s brother had taken his entire family to America in the mid-1800s, some 50 years
before. If Wendelin’s father had mentioned an existence of a long lost brother, we again will never know. Wendelin had not even
been born when his uncle decided to flee the Hegau to try his luck in America. Nor do we know what Wendelin’s dad might have
told him about having a brother who had immigrated to America. His immigration might have been met with resentment in that he
was able to leave and his dad had to stay. Wendelin, however, was obviously pleased, for it would give him an opportunity to show
off if that even mattered to him. Also, Joseph could come home from Lake Constance as well to meet his long lost cousin. Vincent
Wieser, however, was returning for purely nostalgic reasons, and it is very doubtful that he was intending to renew acquaintances. He
had been born there many years before. His children seemed to care less about their roots and none, not even Vincent’s wife, wished
to return to Germany. Now, in his seventies and knowingly growing weaker, he wanted to see his birthplace one more time before
his days on earth were over.
Vincent’s pilgrimage would change the lives of two of his German cousins in ways he could never have fathomed or
intended. Vincent, living in America since 1856, had accompanied his family at the age of 19 as an immigrant to the United States.
There in the North, the family lived throughout the Civil War. With hard work and determination, Vincent became a very successful
businessman, a multi-millionaire who truly had experienced the American dream.^1 Now at the age of 73, he sought to make a final
pilgrimage to the village of his birth. As he posed for a souvenir ship’s photograph, he stared ahead with his steely, determined eyes
focused toward the east, wondering how his village may have changed in the six decades since he had left. At that time his
principality of Baden was not even part of the new Germany. Now Germany was unified by a single king and as an economic power
was ranked the number one industrial nation on earth. Just once more, he thought if he could visit the places, the memories of which
were faintly kept only in his mind, his life would be complete, and he could die in peace a happy and contented man.</p>

Vincent’s success in America, as many others who had preceded him, set an example of the rewards that awaited those who
worked hard in America. Individual effort and the freedom to work in jobs unavailable and unthinkable to average Europeans could
result in an opportunity to attain financial gain. That kind of opportunity for success appealed directly to Joseph who already firmly
believed that hard work coupled with a sound education could lead to his eventual success. Ernst, Joseph’s younger brother, being
only nine at the time, was still too young to understand or even care about such opportunities, and that was quite natural and normal,
for what nine-year-old would have given immigration much thought at that age? Anna was expecting some rich gifts of chocolates or
other exiting things from their American cousin. Little did Vincent suspect that he was having such a profound impact on their lives.
Little did Anna realize that their American cousin would only bring them rosaries.^3
Vincent embarked for the United States with a fixed intention of becoming a citizen of a freer and better country than his
native land. His parents had first chosen to settle in Williamsport, Indiana in 1856 and there put down roots. As the frontier moved</p>

<p>ever farther westward, so did Vincent’s family, finally settling in Iowa.^4 Rushing to the bedside of a stricken son in Texas, he
discovered great opportunities there and in 1889, at an age when most men would be content to live out their lives in the community
they have called home, Vincent moved his family to Texas, that state barely approaching its first half-century as a member of the
American union.
Vincent Wieser, a flour miller by profession, allegedly was so impressed with the mildness of the climate and friendliness of
the people that he resolved to make it his home. He moved the balance of his nine children to Texas (the one who allegedly was ill
was also named Joseph, but why he was in Texas remains unknown) and purchased an existing gristmill and cotton gin in 1891. The
mill in Hico^5 was quite profitable and soon other milling properties in the Central Texas area were purchased by him and his sons.
These included the Dublin Flour Mill and Elevator Company, the Munday Mill and Elevator Company, Stanford Mill and Elevator
Company, Hamilton Mill and Elevator Company, Grain and Elevator Company at Iredell, J. F. Wieser &amp; Co., Inc., Hico Roller Mills,
Waco Mill &amp; Elevator Company, the Texas Company, and in other Texas locations, including Fort Worth and Cisco. The Hamilton
Mill and Elevator Company also owned the Hamilton Light &amp; Power Company, The Dublin Power and Light Company, Inc., and
the Hico Electric Light and Power Company were also owned in the partnership with his sons, a partnership that lasted until his
death in 1916.^6
Additionally, Vincent installed the first telephone system at Hico, which was extended to Hamilton by the purchase of
existing telegraph lines. Telephone service was also extended to the neighboring towns of Carlton, Iredell, and Walnut Springs. The
Electric Company was eventually incorporated under the title of Central Texas Power and Transmission Company. His investment
and interests in various banking concerns created the Hico National Bank. In addition, he also established Hico Ice and Cold Storage
Co. and Hico Cotton Compress.^7 Vincent had done very well in America!
Upon arriving in Germany, Vincent wasted no time in Hamburg. He was on a mission and took immediate steps to secure
travel south to Stuttgart by rail and farther south to Tuttlingen and then finally to the village of his birth by carriage. In
Volkertshausen, Vincent made inquires and soon visited with his long forgotten family members and with their help, identified the
descendants of those his family had left behind many decades before. The experience was undoubtedly not unlike that which was
experienced five decades later when Joseph’s family arrived to be introduced to their cousins. It was one of pure unadulterated joy!
The smiles radiating in the faces of those who remained in Germany cannot be forgotten, for their joy was clearly packed with an
overwhelming emotion and with such warmth that visitors felt an instant sense of belonging. It was a true reunion! The wine was
brought out of their cellar and the table covered with their finest linens and set with their best bone china. Heaped on the table were
a variety of breads and cheeses and farm-made sausages that put anything available in America to shame. It was as if they dined this
way each and every day. It was a Kaffeeklatsch^8 not to be forgotten! Coffee was brewed to perfection in the most simplistic manner,
the aroma of which radiated along with the warmth of the emotions being generated in the room. Dessert, perhaps a stone-in cherry
pie, was generously offered to those who had returned. One dared not refuse any offering for fear of giving offense. Maria certainly
put forth her best efforts to make Wendelin’s American cousin feel at home. Then, as things settled down, one saw in their eyes the
great anticipation of hearing and learning of what life was like in America.</p>

Vincent took a room at the <em>Gasthaus zum Löwen</em> where he met the owner, his first cousin, for the very first time. Wendelin
was Vincent’s father’s nephew, who had not yet been born when Vincent’s father moved his family to America. Vincent would note
in his diary that he was not impressed with Wendelin.^10 However, also present and home for a short visit was Joseph, Wendelin’s
oldest son. Vincent met and struck a special relationship with Joseph, for he was impressed with the young man’s appearance,
intelligence, and determination. Apparently, Vincent immediately saw that Joseph was obviously not cut from Wendelin’s cloth.
Joseph, or Bob as he was called by friends at this time, was employed as a bookkeeper at Bass &amp; Keller^11 in Langenargen, a beautiful
lakeside city, a short two hours distant by rail from Volkertshausen. Joseph listened intently as Vincent described opportunities in
America and exiting tales from Texas. Vincent could see that Joseph had qualities that he liked to see in young men: ambition,
intelligence, and a burning desire to make something of oneself. Here was such a young man! It is doubtful that Vincent knew of the</p>

<p>problems between Wendelin and Joseph. However, any student of behavior can sense when things are not what they should be, and
Vincent may have had some idea of their relationship. Still, here was a perfect candidate for introducing to the American way of life
and opportunity! If no invitation to join Vincent in Texas was offered, an invitation to correspond was, and so Vincent took the
young Joseph under his wing.
Vincent had set out by train from his home in Hico, Texas on July 6th, but none of his family accompanied him on this
quest, although initially accompanied by a Brother Gieseke, a Catholic priest who intended to return with Vincent. Brother Gieseke
became ill en route and after delaying their journey for three days at St. Louis, he gave up and returned home. Vincent could wait no
longer. He now proceeded alone, arrived in New York City on the morning of the 12th, and boarded the SS <em>President Grant</em> at its dock
the next day at noon. The ship left at one o’clock sharp and immediately encountered a heavy dense fog that required the constant
use of foghorns and forced the ship to decrease its speed to what seemed like a crawl to Vincent. Vincent enjoyed 1st class
accommodations, five meals daily, and serenades by a full brass band. The SS <em>President</em> Grant with its 900 passengers finally docked
at Hamburg, Germany on July 24, after an 11-day journey.^12 His first class accommodations brought him some satisfaction, for the SS
<em>President Grant</em> was certainly quite a ship.
As was the custom during transatlantic journeys at the time, Vincent took his turn to sit for a photograph taken of his
passage, a souvenir for his family. Being the senior member of this group, he sat prominently in the center, resting his left hand on
the ship’s life preserver while staring directly at the photographer. The weather for July must have been quite cold for the North
Atlantic, for all were dressed as if traveling in the depth of winter. Nothing was noted of Vincent’s travel companions shown in this
photograph, although all are named and apparently German. All they apparently had in common was that they most likely just
happened to be on board the same ship.</p>

Shortly after landing in Hamburg, Vincent embarked by train for Stuttgart and on to Schlott, the nearest station to
Volkertshausen. There he had to board a stagecoach and arrived finally on Wednesday, July 27, 1910, fifteen days after leaving New
York.^14 That first Sunday Vincent celebrated Mass in the church in which he had been baptized some 73 years earlier.^15 The changes
that always occur in one’s absence must have been striking to him. The church was located next to the <em>Gasthaus zum Löwen</em>. He had
learned that it was owned by a relative and making the inn his headquarters allowed him a chance to really get to know Wendelin and
his family. He spent the month of August visiting relatives and places around the village. Vincent was able to recall every house and
every street, bringing back memories from his childhood. He had often told stories when as a little boy, he and others would lie
immobile on a footbridge that spanned the Aach River and catch trout by hand.^16 Now he walked along its banks once again and
reflected on his childhood memories.
What would his life have been like had his father not taken them to America? He could only surmise and counted himself
blessed that he had immigrated. He seemed often to be impatient and felt a need to see things more quickly, for every now and then,</p>

<p>the pains in his stomach reminded him that his time was limited. Nevertheless, he took time to make a small journey by train to
Oberammergau to see the Passion Play^17 and another short visit to Schaffhausen on the Swiss border to seek relatives who had
moved there. How many times he talked with Joseph is not known, but Vincent did make an impression on the young man. Here,
thought Joseph, was a perfect example of what hard work can accomplish. Obviously, as Vincent’s month-long visit drew to a close,
Vincent and Joseph agreed to keep in touch. An invitation was extended for a position with one of his companies, but for now
Joseph was still exploring his own options and wished to see where his employment in Langenargen would take him.</p>

The local family records at the Catholic Church in Volkertshausen note many born there to have immigrated with no further
information. Many individuals simply vanished. Vincent’s arrival and probably his return to the city of his birth could not have failed
to cause a sensation in Volkertshausen even though he had given notice many months in advance. Many relatives now stopped at the
Gastehaus zum Löwen to meet the man of whom they had heard so much.
Uncle Vincent’s visit and meeting the son of his first cousin was a reunion that changed the lives of two cousins. Yet at the
time, Joseph had already set out on his career with all he undoubtedly knew of Germany’s bright future. It seemed highly unlikely
that he was willing to forgo the opportunities that he saw for himself in Langenargen at that time to immigrate to the wild west state
of Texas at a simple request from an uncle whom he hardly knew. Joseph had good cause to accept Vincent’s invitation, for he had
no chance to join his father in business. Still, something was preventing his immigration in 1910. Perhaps he was still too immature,
an unlikely conclusion. Perhaps leaving family members, especially his mother, friends, his homeland, and a good job was a very
difficult thing to do under any circumstance. Nevertheless, Vincent had planted the seed, a seed of opportunity; however, Joseph was
not yet ready. Joseph needed time to think and to take a deeper look at his rapidly changing world.
After bidding farewell to relatives, all know that they will not see one another again. This was a final farewell, but those left
behind recalled his visit for decades. He had become wealthy and was the example of what one could become in America if given the
opportunity. Vincent boarded the <em>SS George Washington</em> for his return voyage on September 1, being welcomed on board with another
brass band just as he had experienced in New York. This time the ship’s band, however, played the Star Spangled Banner. On
September 11, he landed at Hoboken, New Jersey and boarded a train that took him north to Niagara Falls before finally returning to
Texas.^19 Whether he also visited relatives in Iowa was not recorded in his diary, but since Vincent had set out to revisit the places of
his youth, it would seem logical that he would take time to visit with relatives left behind in Iowa.
Upon Vincent’s return home, he and Joseph continued a limited correspondence which at some point hinted at an invitation
for Joseph to come to work for him in Texas. Vincent offered to make it possible. Joseph would always refer to Vincent as his
uncle, but in fact, he was a second cousin. Wendelin was actually Vincent’s first cousin; their fathers, Francisus Antonius and
Benedikt, had been brothers.* Vincent’s grandfather Jacob Christoph, recognized as a good citizen of Volkertshausen, was also
Joseph’s great grandfather, but Vincent and Wendelin had never met until August 1910. Two letters survive from Vincent that were
written upon Vincent’s return home. No more were apparently written thereafter, and it is highly unlikely that Wendelin bothered to
respond to either. The first was quite typical of the kind that one writes to thank everyone for what they did for him. It is obvious
that Vincent had made quite an effort to visit as many relatives as he could for the month that he was there.</p>

Hico, Texas – October 14, 1910

<em>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Wendelin Wieser, Volkertshausen, and valued Cousins and Family:</em></p>

<p><em>You most certainly will have received by now the letter I wrote to you and your daughter (Anna) on my way home. I should have written you
earlier, but when I arrived home, there was a mountain of work for me to do which I have just now abated somewhat. On my way home, I stopped at
Hüfingen in Oos (Baden Baden), the home town of my wife, then in Freiburg, then Oos, then in Straßbourg and back to Karlsruhe, Mannheim, and from
there on to Cologne. When I was in Oos, I saw the Zeppelin that operates there and in Straßbourg. I also saw the one from Cologne to Bremen where, as I
had written on my card, we took our leave of Germany. Now I am back at work as before, feeding two horses and a cow every day. In my absence my wife
sold another cow and squandered all the money from the proceeds. Otherwise, everything was pretty much in order. It is still pretty warm here, as much as
35º Celsius, and I am sweating again instead of freezing, as I did in Germany. The farmers here have little to do but to pick cotton, which is bringing a good
price. Wheat is $1.05 a bushel (60 pounds).</em></p>

<p><em>I have also written letters to Burgomeister Schädler and his family and Emilie Schädler. It would make me very happy if they would take those
letters to Mr. Schmid and his daughters, Anna and Louise, to read for I am just too busy to write long letters.* My brother, Andreas, and his oldest
daughter have a desire to make a trip to Germany next year, but no decision has been made. He is 1 ½ years younger than me, but not nearly as strong. I
recovered quite a lot on the voyage home and discovered that I had gained five pounds by the time I arrived back in Hico. Otherwise, we are all doing well
and hope that this letter finds all of you well. We all await an answer from you. Many thanks for all that you did for me during my trip that made my visit
such a pleasant experience.</em></p>

<p><em>Your Cousin Vincent F. Wieser</em></p>

<p><em>And also give my greetings to your wife and daughter, Anna. Anna should “eat hearty” and to eat to her “hearts content.” (Forgive me when I
have to write some things in English.)</em></p>

<p><em>I wrote a card to F. K. Dietz,* in care of your Gasthaus zum Löwen. I also wrote to your son, Joseph, in Langenargen, as he had expressed a
desire to learn English.</em></p>

<p><em>V. F. Wieser</em>
A second letter from Vincent has survived and was discovered in 2008 among the letters and papers in the possession of
Lieselotte Ehrensperger, Anna’s daughter who lives in Tuttlingen.</p>

<p><code>
Hico, Texas – December 14, 1910
</code>
<em>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Wendelin Wieser, Dear Cousins and All:</em></p>

<p><em>I can never forget what a good and wonderful time I experienced with you in the short time I was able to visit with you. I will never be able to
thank you enough for your hospitality and now that Christmas is fast upon us again and the New Year approaches, I want to extend my best wishes for the
Christmas season and the New Year to you. This may be as old of an expression as two and two, but nothing says it better. It remains as true today and
expresses the thoughts of thanks between men who wish to find the way to wish each other the best – good health and happiness. As you may have heard, I
was welcomed home by my family upon my return with open arms.</em></p>

<p><em>I received a postcard from your son, Joseph, in Langenargen and written in English promising to write me a long letter. I answered him straight
away in the best German that I could write, but have received no answer from him yet. I also have not heard from the young Dietz or from Emilie Schädler
or my Hico friend, Decklin, and his relatives in Schaffhausen.</em>^20 <em>My second oldest son, Heinrich, met a young man in Sherman, Texas, who told him he was
related to Wiesers who lived in Losstedten.* He gave him his card but has seen nothing of him since. For the past two months I have not been feeling so
well nor am I as strong as before. I caught a terrific cold but am now much better.</em></p>

<p><em>We have been having very dry weather this year and the harvest has been very light. Prices, however, have remained high. The temperatures have
been quite low for now and hover between 15 and 25 degrees Celsius; however, most of our coldest weather occurs after the first of the year. It appears that we
will soon be bringing a second rail into Hico. I have been working on that for a long time and will finally see the results of my efforts. I will close for now
with my best wishes to you and everyone whom I met.</em></p>

<p><em>“From your ever-loving cousin and uncle.”</em></p>

<p><em>Vincent Wieser</em></p>

<p>Vincent eventually provided the money for Joseph’s travel expenses and offered him employment in one of his mills.
Vincent would become a father figure to Joseph, one like Joseph had never known: someone in whom to confide in and ask for help
(and he would more than once, especially when in financial straits) and someone in whom he could trust and seek advice. Vincent
was a decent person, well-liked, and respected in his community. He was someone of whom people spoke highly, not in whispers as
they did of Wendelin. Vincent was everything that the young Joseph respected and hoped to become. Joseph could continue
working as an accountant, or he could strike out on his own. Here, from America, was a cousin who had proved that America was
the land of opportunity and had extended an invitation to come and work for him. With such an invitation, the question arises. Why
did Joseph wait nearly four more years before accepting Vincent’s offer? Additionally, Vincent was dying and his time on earth was
limited. Whether that was conveyed to family members overseas is simply not known. If Joseph wished to immigrate, he needed to
make up his mind..</p>

<p><code>

A Solemn Joseph Benedict Contemplates his future
As the Gastehaus zum Löwen
</code>
Joseph was already a young man of twenty-one when “Uncle” Vincent returned to Volkertshausen, Germany in 1910.
Vincent had immigrated to America at the age of nineteen. How much Joseph had heard of his grandfather’s brother and his family
in America would be only speculation at this point. However, knowing something of the character of Joseph's father, most likely
there was little, if anything, said about the brother of Wendelin’s father immigrating to America. Perhaps they wrote home or
perhaps all contact was severed. The fact that in Vincent’s second letter states that he has heard from no one makes it pretty clear
that the relatives in Volkertshausen were not exactly prompt and timely in responding to letter writing. One thing for certain is that
Wendelin did not invite Vincent to return. Vincent’s immigration and possibly Joseph’s would be just two incidents among thousands</p>

<p>of other Germans who had vanished from small towns across Germany. If they began to write one another, no letters survived on
either side of the Atlantic except these two and one postcard received by Joseph from Vincent. Enough of a rapport was established
between Vincent and Joseph for him to either ask for help in getting to America or for him to let it be known that he might consider
immigrating.
One reason for the failure of further writing may have been due to what happened to the marriage between Maria and
Wendelin. By 1911 Wendelin became more boorish in his behavior. Joseph was completing his obligation to the reservist garrison at
Lazarett located in Weingarten I. W. but was returning home less and less frequently. He now had new interests and made new
friends, not only as a soldier but also at work in Langenargen. He had no time for his father’s pettiness. He freely gave his advice to
his mother, but she seemed to be unable to take steps to secure her freedom from his tyranny. Maria was left with her two youngest
children and a husband who daily grew more arrogant and insolent. Nothing Maria could do made much difference to Wendelin.
Wendelin continued his pandering ways and now began to do so much more openly.
As the remaining children grew to maturity (Anna was turning 15, and Ernst was still 12), the infidelity of Wendelin became
harder to conceal, not only from his children, but also from others in the village. Since 1909 the <em>Gasthaus zum Löwen</em> had provided
Wendelin with the perfect cover he needed to hide his philandering. Bit by bit, however, he began to flaunt his infidelities more
openly and more viciously before Maria. It seemed to be that his goal was to humiliate and shame her still further. Wendelin now
brought his mistress openly into the Gasthaus zum Löwen and demanded that Maria serve him and his mistresses. The shame and
humiliation felt by Maria must have been terrible. If he was intending to destroy his family and his reputation, he was making an
excellent attempt at it.</p>

At first she endured his insults, for that was what was expected of wives in the Hegau. Later, when such conduct could no
longer be concealed, Joseph advised her to file for divorce. Maria ignored that advice, for she feared being alone. The
embarrassment of being a divorced woman was more humiliating than what she had to endure from his behavior. All guilt and blame
fell upon the female. What would people think of her being unable to keep her marriage vows? How would she survive? Where
would she find work? She could not leave her children. What would become of them? She simply refused to leave Wendelin’s side no
matter how much Joseph urged her to do so and no matter how much she suffered. Having suffered already such immense
humiliation in her life, she was not about to suffer more.
The marriage between Maria and Wendelin had been a marriage of convenience for both. For him, he would finally have
someone who would marry him, give him children, and win him respect in his village. For her, she would finally be free from the
shame of remaining unmarried for so long. Running Wendelin’s small farm, rearing his children, and eventually slaving to do all the
work at the Gasthaus zum Löwen was not necessarily a duty and obligation rare among women at that time either in the Hegau or
anywhere throughout Germany for that matter. Nevertheless, it was a loveless marriage, and the openness with which Wendelin
flaunted his extramarital affairs had to weigh heavily on Maria. It may have surprised her, but it was doubtful if it surprised others in
Volkertshausen who whispered about him behind his back. Wendelin was not well-respected in Volkertshausen despite his ability to
prosper. Yet, his sisters seemed to stand by him. It was doubtful that they had ever really approved of Maria.
Joseph repeatedly suggested that his mother file for divorce as he became more aware of Wendelin’s real character. He
never forgave Wendelin for the beatings that he had suffered and now for the humiliation he was causing his mother. His mother’s
consistent refusal to divorce angered Joseph. He just could not understand how insecure she felt. Joseph did not have much
patience with those who refused his free advice. As much as he loved his mother, she angered him now more than ever. He just
could not understand how insecure she felt. Joseph now insulated himself with indifference. Still, he could not ignore the pleas which
now reached him in letters. Time after time, Maria would ask her oldest son for advice and when given, would repeatedly fail to act
upon it. Joseph lost his patience. It was a pattern that Maria would play for the rest of her life, indecisive and uncertain. Joseph
eventually could not tolerate it, and his only recourse was to withhold writing letters and to say nothing more. Why was he being
asked for help if his suggestions were ignored?
Then in 1912, when Maria herself could at last no longer endure the embarrassment or the indignity she had suffered, she
gathered every ounce of courage she had, and much to the total disbelief and bewilderment of Wendelin, fled the Gasthaus zum
Löwen to her sister’s house. Brigitta, who had married a farmer by the name of Brienlinger, lived on a place known as the <em>Gehrihof</em>.^22
Finally, Maria had taken the first step at showing defiance to Wendelin, and while many may have applauded her courage, others were</p>

<p>sure to place the blame squarely on her shoulders. By this time, Joseph may well have given up in encouraging her to leave and met
the news with some indifference. Not even her sister welcomed her with open arms, but Wendelin had now to consider, perhaps for
the first time in his life, what others might think of him. Would others conclude that his behavior had driven the only woman, a good
woman and the only decent woman who would have him, from his door? Would it expose further, his poor behavior over all these
years? How would he endure in Volkertshausen now that his cover (his marriage) was exposed as the sham that it was? Now some
could easily see that it was his fault. Perhaps for the first time in his sordid life, Wendelin felt shame. Some of the shame, as was the
custom at the time, was directly aimed at Maria. Not surprisingly, it also came from her sister who made it abundantly clear that she
too wanted no part of Maria’s problems. It was the same feeling that she had felt while she had lived on the Buhlhof for all those
years, unwanted and unmarried.
Faced with rejection wherever she turned, it was now her daughter, Anna, who along with Ernst had fled with her to the
<em>Gehrihof</em> , who took up the challenge to alter their lives. While her mother had summoned the courage to do the unthinkable, her
mother was now reduced to sobbing uncontrollable for hours in the home of her sister. Anna quickly understood that they had not
been welcomed as guests and that if her mother did not soon resolve what she should do, she, at 15, would have to make decisions
for them. Anna soon realized that there was no chance of employment at the Gehrihof, and without money they could not afford to
stay. Going to live in the poorhouse was clearly an option open to them, but one that Anna refused to consider. To have lived there
in the village in which she was born for all these years and now be forced to move there was too much of embarrassment and shame
to bear. That Maria had brought such shame upon herself and her children would have been unbearable, for everyone in the village
would have known it was she that had left, and none would have had sympathy for her. It simply was not the custom. At that time
the man could do no wrong. Anna had decided that she would not allow that. Anna’s only option was to seek employment
elsewhere, and the nearest larger town was Tuttlingen in Württemberg. As she had no bicycle and could borrow none from those at
the Gehrihof, she walked to Tuttlingen to see for herself what employment she could find. It was a strange turn of events for a girl
of 15 to find herself. Once she had had dreams of studying piano just to be able to play the one that Wendelin had in the Gastehaus
zum Löwen and hopes of becoming a teacher. Wendelin had forbidden both, but she had until now not lost all hope. Now such
dreams were just that, only dreams, as reality set in with a vengeance. It became obvious to her that if she, her mother, and brother
were to remain together, much less stay alive, it would be because of her.
In Tuttlingen she inquired from house to house and offered her services as a <em>Putzfrau,</em>^23 the only work she knew well as she
had helped her mother at the Gasthaus zum Löwen for years. She found work rather quickly and shortly thereafter also found an
attic space to rent in the Karlstraße. Then she returned to the Gehrihof to bring her mother the first good news in weeks. It was
welcomed news by those there and they convinced her mother that she needed to go with Anna. And so, with a heavy heart and fear
beyond description, she agreed to accompany Anna back to Tuttlingen. Ernst tagged along unaware of the real implications of what
his mother had done. Then at her first opportunity, Anna returned boldly to Volkertshausen to gather clothing and other items
sorely needed by them and risked a confrontation with Wendelin in the progress. Just entering the Gasthaus zum Löwen had to have
been frightening. To face the possibility of running into the anger of her father, much less the towering stature of the man whose
temper knew no bounds, was daunting. But she was determined to defend the actions of her mother no matter what threats he
might have offered. And she could always warn her father that Joseph himself might come to their rescue if he offered resistance.
That would have been a stretch, for she probably knew that Joseph had reached the end of his patience with their mother.
However, she had no transportation, and she could only take what she could carry or perhaps pull in a wagon
commandeered from a neighbor. It must have given Wendelin some satisfaction that it caused her some difficulty to take those
things all the way to Tuttlingen. However, it was all that he would allow Anna to take. After obviously weeks of planning, Wendelin
demonstrated that he could be as obstinate as Maria. Without warning he sold the Gasthaus zum Löwen, his house behind the
church, his small handkerchief-size farm, all his livestock (probably consisting of only a cow, a pig, and a few chickens), furniture,
inventory, and equipment. Perhaps he had been warned by whatever friend that he might have had left, that if Joseph succeeded in
convincing Maria to file the divorce papers that he had assembled for her, Wendelin might have to share equally all that he had
accumulated with Maria in almost a quarter century of marriage. In the weeks that followed Maria’s departure, Wendelin converted
everything to cash from the sale and moved to Lottesettep, a small village near the Swiss border where another sister of his lived.
There he took a room to share with his latest mistresses. Maria was now literally locked out of her home as Anna shortly thereafter
discovered. She was unable to gather as much as another single suitcase, and what personal possessions were left belonging to Maria,
Wendelin’s sisters now possessed and guarded as if they were theirs alone. One, however, promised Anna that one day she would
give Anna some of her mother’s possessions, but that day never arrived.^24 Anna was stunned.
Neighbors could not have helped but known what Wendelin had done. Still, no one in the village became involved.
Perhaps such things happened in such small villages throughout the Hegau on a regular basis; families that disintegrated left children
from those marriages totally disinherited. One family’s trouble did not seem to generate a need among others for becoming involved.
At that time there still was in Volkertshausen, as in every village in the Hegau, a place for such destitute people to go. It was known
as the poorhouse. This ancient relic was still in play in the Hegau in the early decades of the 20th century and very much a factor or
choice from which Maria had to choose. This was where those who had nothing, absolutely nothing, could live. There, at least, one
could be given something to eat and accept jobs performing day labor wherever offered work. Often such residents were paid only in
food. There, too, they were often the butt of ridicule and children from the poorhouse were often teased beyond mercy. Maria could
not possibly have survived such public humiliation in her village. Having fallen from somewhat of a prominent position of innkeeper
to being totally destitute was more than any person can bear. Maria could not have born that at all, and Anna was not going to allow
that. Already racked with doubts about the path that she had chosen, Maria was reduced to wailing for hours, lamenting for what she
had done. Had she made the right decision? Had she been goaded by Joseph? What was going to become of her now?</p>

<p>It was not Maria who had gathered her courage and strength to see that she had made the right decision. She was not like
Joseph, who would bear down and survive. Maria had no such inner strength, and Joseph, who was in nearby Langenargen, had
made it perfectly clear sometime earlier what Maria should have done a long time ago. For years she had not listened. Now he had
washed his hands of it. He had prepared everything that she needed to complete her divorce. Still, for years she could not do what
Joseph had told her. Now that she had finally acted, she knew her firstborn well enough to known that she could not have turned to
him. Wendelin had done exactly what Joseph had predicted. Now, it was too late. While Maria wept, Anna stepped up to do
something. She acted and she decided that they were not going to beg to be allowed to stay at the Gehrihof and certainly were not
going to move into the poorhouse that stood in Volkertshausen where they would have been submitted to the shame that Maria had
brought upon herself and her children. Anna’s move to Tuttlingen proved to be a good choice, even though Wendelin soon learned
where they had fled.
Tuttlingen is an ancient Roman city that lay just outside of the Hegau and is part of the Schwäbische Alps.^25 Only a short
distance from Volkertshausen, Tuttlingen was quite unlike villages that lay in Baden. The town was famous for being the home of the
“Tuttlinger Wanderer,”^26 a legendary fictional tale about an inhabitant’s excursion to the Netherlands, and for Aesculap, world-
renowned maker of the finest surgical instruments known. Tuttlingen was already a large sizeable town that offered Anna an
opportunity to find work better than in other area towns. Best of all, they would be away from all the whispers and eyes that were
certain to be on them had they remained in Volkertshausen.
With Maria reduced to tears and incapable of making a single decision and with Ernst, only 12, Tuttlingen became their
refuge and their new home. Anna’s promising career as a teacher was now at an end. Ernst soon learned that their move there had
been a permanent one as Anna enrolled him in school there. Anna would find herself suddenly thrust into a role that was far too
demanding of a girl her age, but Anna had no choice. In Langenargen, an angry Joseph had been of no help, for he had given his
mother his advice, and she had not chosen to heed it. As far as he was concerned, Maria had to suffer the consequences, even if it
meant his sister and brother would also suffer.
Meanwhile, having to make decisions, Anna was able to eventually set up a home of sorts at 27 Wilehlmstraße. She and
Joseph could argue later about what she should have done. If he did not wish to help, that was his problem. Leaving Volkertshausen
broke their mother’s spirit. She never recovered from the shame nor admitted the reality of it. Since Maria was completely reduced
to a state of shock that evolved into days of sobbing that physically rendered her unable and unqualified to find employment, it fell
upon Anna to secure a job and provide for their needs. Anna became the bread earner at fifteen, for their very survival fell squarely
on her shoulders. Joseph offered no assistance even after learning of their plight to the Gehrihof and his mother’s move to
Tuttlingen to be with Anna. It was the smart thing for them to have done, but he always thought that fleeing to the country was
where one should go to avoid danger. Meanwhile, able to ignore the reality of what his mother and siblings were going through,
Joseph took a new position in Stuttgart and did nothing to help at this time. After all, he had his own life to live. He had, after all,
spent most of his life getting an education, and now that he was on his own, he did not wish to be bothered with problems that he
had for years tried to avoid. Had his mother listened to him, she would not have been in this situation. Now she would have to suffer
the consequences of her action.
Wendelin had no such qualms, for he established a new home near Stein am Rhein.^27 His sister Veronika^28 kept an eye on
his things in Volkertshausen and saw to it that as little of Maria’s things as possible were taken from his houses until they were sold.
She had been given much of Maria’s personal things, and she intended to keep them all for herself. In the years that followed, it
would be her surveillance and recognizance that protected her brother as she and her sisters had always done. His sources soon had
informed him where Maria and his children were living. He also learned what Anna had collected and where she was taking those
things not that that had been something that Maria or Anna had intended to keep from him. Once, while on vacation in Einsideln,^29
a resort located in Switzerland, he wrote and mailed this postcard to Anna and Ernst, pointedly ignoring their mother and attempting
to lay a heavy guilt on them for ignoring him.</p>

How many times did Anna read this card? The hatred she felt toward her father must have been unimaginable. She never
wrote. She could not be sentimental. Anna found work in Tuttlingen at a number of places, among them at Stotz Candy Company, a
business still in operation today as <em>Storz Schokolade</em>. She also found work in cleaning houses and doing a little bookkeeping. Like all
girls in Volkertshausen, she had learned to sew as a youngster, and now she became an excellent seamstress, altering clothes and
sewing new dresses. This led to her eventual employment in a local shoe factory. There she would acquire skills that eventually
allowed her to earn a good wage. After her marriage, it would be Anna who always brought home the bigger check. The first years
were, without a doubt, the most difficult for them. Her mother’s clothes were soon in tatters. Once, Maria went to a house where
Anna was working just to drop in on her daughter. Anna was in such shock and embarrassment at seeing that her mother’s clothing
made her look like a common tramp, that she introduced her to her employer as her aunt. The slight did not go unnoticed, but what
could Maria say?^33 She had relinquished her right to rule her family. It was Anna who was now in charge.
Anna and her mother always had a shortage of basic necessities. Often there was simply not enough money for food. Anna
eventually found additional employment on weekends in the nearby village of Emmendorf, but one that required her a few hours to
reach by bicycle. There she worked in a Gasthaus for the day, spent Saturday nights, returned late Sunday evening bringing what
leftovers were given her home to her mother and brother. Such was the level to which their lives had sunk since leaving
Volkertshausen.
It was Anna now who took the lead in making decisions for the family. Joseph was fully aware of their plight, but if ever
asked, offered only advice. After having had his advice ignored, he did not offer much anymore save for what he might think Anna</p>

<p>should do to help make her situation easier. In time, from afar, Joseph had resolved that he would reluctantly give a little advice
when asked, but nothing more. Meanwhile, Anna worked hard to make money and kept Ernst enrolled in school. Everything they
had known or had experienced in Volkertshausen was now only a distant memory. They now lived in the <em>Schäbian Alpen,</em> a different
state, for Württemberg that had different customs even if it was only miles from where they had been all their lives. People here
spoke differently, if only slightly, but definitely a different dialect. Anna was becoming a Tuttlinger. Their life in Volkertshausen was
now only a memory.</p>

(^5) <strong>Hico</strong> is located in North Central Texas at the junction of U.S. Highway 281 and State Highways 6 and 220, in northeastern
Hamilton County. A post office was first established in 1860. By 1874, the town had eight businesses, including a cotton gin, although
most residents raised cattle and horses. Construction of the Texas Central Railroad in 1880 prompted its citizens to move the hamlet
2½ miles to the line. Hico was incorporated in 1883 and became the county's shipping center. The population was 1,480 in 1890
when a fire destroyed business houses on the east side of Pecan Street. A few weeks later, another fire ravaged the west side.
Rebuilding in stone ended the fire menace, but periodic overflows of the Bosque River have remained a threat to low-lying areas.
Over the years, Hico has prospered as cotton and cattle market center. In 1940, although its population had declined to 1,242, the
town was incorporated and had a post office, a bank, and fifty businesses, but the Wieser mills had been moved, first to Hamilton,
and finally to Lampasas. Hico continued to decline and had a population low of 925 in 1970, but it is slowly rebounding. <em>Handbook of

Now, in its seventh year of service, it was carrying Vincent back to the country of his birth. In just under another four years of
commercial operation, the S.S. <em>President Grant</em> would take refuge at New York, then a neutral port, when the outbreak of World War I
made the high seas unsafe for any German merchant ship, and she remained inactive until the United States entered the conflict. She
then was seized by the U.S. Government and placed in commission as the transport <em>President Grant</em>. During the balance of the First
World War, she made sixteen round trips across the Atlantic, transporting nearly 40,000 passengers (mainly U.S. troops) to the
European war zone. Following the 1918 Armistice, the S.S. <em>President Grant</em> brought home over 37,000 war veterans. She was
decommissioned in October 1919. No restitution was offered to her German owners. - USS President Grant -

(^17) The Oberammergau Passion Play is a passion play performed since 1634 as a tradition by the inhabitants of the village of
Oberammergau, Bavaria, Germany. The town’s residents vowed that if God were to spare them from the effects of the bubonic
plague ravaging the region, they would perform a play every ten years thereafter for all time, depicting the life and death of Jesus. -

(^18) <strong>S. S. George Washington</strong> - Built in 1908, and just two years in service, the S. S. _George Washington</em> was one of the most reliable and
popular liners though not among the fastest on the North Atlantic. Aimed squarely at American tourists like Vincent, her first class
was outfitted in a clean-lined style influenced by the early work of Frank Lloyd Wright, complete with oil paintings of American
heritage scenes. She was Germany's largest liner when built, and carried nearly 2,900 passengers in four classes, including large
steerage. Traveling to America in first class, Vincent was certainly making a statement. After all, he had immigrated some sixty years</p>

<p>earlier on board a lowly steamer, in steerage, as had millions seeking a better life in America. The S. S. <em>Washington</em> would also be
affected by the Great War. She was taken over by the Americans as a troopship when the United States entered World War I. She
survived the war and carried President Wilson to the Versailles Peace Conference and back. She was then given to the United States
Lines, who used her in passenger service until 1931. A fire broke out aboard her in 1947, leading to her lay-up once more. She
burned a final time while moored at her Baltimore pier in 1951 and was finally scrapped. -

Losstedten was the same town to which Wendelin fled after leaving Maria. A sister of his also lived there.
(^21) This photograph of Joseph smoking a cigarette was taken inside the Gastehaus zum Löwen. It shows a very serious, very reflective
Joseph perhaps pondering his next move. How much did he know of his mother’s intentions? The photographs on the wall are of
Vincent and Maria. This photo was taken ca 1911.
(^22) <strong>The Gehrihof,</strong> unlike the Buhlhof, was only a collection of houses grouped together by necessity to offer homes for Brigitta’s
family and relatives in earning a living in repairing equipment, gardening, and other sundry ways. There was no room for another
mouth to feed, much less three.

Waldburger, told Anna that perhaps one day she would give some of her mother’s linens to her. She never did. Everything that
Maria had accumulated in almost 25 years of marriage to Wendelin was never returned. – Conversation with Lieselotte Ehrensperger</p>
