<p>It was a typical, hot and sweaty, late August summer afternoon in 1917 when J. B. Wieser arrived aboard the San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Northern Railway’s Special from San Antonio. Gone was his Van Dyke<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> and gone was his silk top hat that he had so carefully once packed to insure its survival on his journey from Germany. Already in Texas, it had long been relegated to a standing closet in his room in Hamilton<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> as being out of place in this new land. But its matching heavy, woolen frock coat with its long tails had already offered him some protection against the chilling blasts that frequently accompanied the howling, blue northers as they roared across the rolling hills of North Central Texas unhindered by hundreds of treeless miles of the Grand Prairie and Plains region.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> This was Texas and the cold in Texas had been quite different from that he had known when living along the shores of Lake Constance.[^4] But all of these things in the Europe that he had left behind just three years earlier were very much out of place everywhere in Texas and especially even more so in this remote valley in this part of the Hill Country where fashions were yet even more noticeably lagging behind the rest of the state. None of the woolen things that he had brought prepared him for the heat that he had discovered could linger endlessly for hours on end in his newly adopted land. And now about to step from the single passenger car that had brought him from San Antonio he was encountering the last warming rays of a typical August summer day but found it not quite as humid as that which he had grown to know in Hico, Dublin, Hamilton, or even in San Antonio. It was a drier kind of heat which he instantly found pleasant and very much to his satisfaction. The altitude of his place certainly was refreshing respite.</p>

<p>Disappointed and uncertain about his future in America he had chosen to investigate the little hamlet of which he had heard so much and had avoided until now. The war in Europe had caused tensions across his newly adopted nation, as well as in Texas, to escalate beyond reasonable civil discourse. There arose across this nation of liberty an element of Americans who  hostile toward anything German and anyone German with each succeeding day of the war. Being German was not a good thing to be in the late summer of 1917. As J. B. would later relate, <em>“There were only two native Germans living in Hamilton at that time and when one was lynched late one night I thought it a good time to leave.”</em>[^5] A feeling of security enveloped him as he stepped down onto the depot’s platform. But had he found a new home?</p>

<p>It was not difficult for him to leave the Hico-Hamilton-Dublin, Texas area. His hands were calloused and tough from months of unloading box cars of coal, standing guard as a night watchman, and relegated to a status of a common laborer responsible for cleaning out his uncle’s factory’s outhouses and much of an object of amusement to his uncle’s sons and daughters. Likewise, his indifference to his cousins was firmly cemented by now after three years of snide remarks and humiliating ridicule none of which he ever bothered to counter or acknowledge. His months of study under extreme and frugal living conditions had finally begun to pay off. Only after mastering English, perfecting his Spanish and taking additional accounting courses did J. B. acquire the skills that any of his uncle’s many operations could use. After almost three years in American he had finally risen to head bookkeeper of the Hamilton Mill &amp; Elevator Co., but his uncle Vincent^6 had died in the spring of 1915, and he knew then that his future did not lie with his cousins. He would keep his distance from them, but maintain his options should things not work out for him in Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>While working for his cousins he had also studied law and just in the preceding month had passed his bar examination and opened an office in Hamilton. In a way he hated to leave the area to which he had grown somewhat accustomed, but he felt the growing wave of anti-German sentiment drifting daily closer to town and he worried for his safety. He and his one new friend there, Harvey Chesley, Jr., had travelled to Camp Stanley to volunteer, but J. B. failed his physical and his friend was chosen to go fight the Kaiser.</p>

<p>With no friend left in Hamilton, J. B. decided an investigation into Fredericksburg was necessary. What did he have to lose? Of Vincent, J. B. had once written, that he was his only friend in America. He met Vincent for the first time in 1910 when Vincent, traveling alone, came home to Volkertshausen one last time to see the place of his birth. As fate would have it, Vincent checked in at J. B.’s father’s Gasthaus.^7 There Vincent befriended the young J. B. and filled him with the thoughts that America was still the land of opportunity. An offer of employment was made and it became the reason that four years later J. B. would immigrate to Texas.</p>

<p>The reason for the delay will become known in the forthcoming chapters. However, the affection and assistance given J. B. by his uncle was not assumed or approved by of his uncle’s sons and daughters back in Texas. They resented him from the moment of his arrival in Hico, Texas, and the indifference toward their new immigrant cousin continued to grow only worse after the death of their father. However, by then J. B. was armed with a Bachelor’s of Law, earned through correspondence and after study under Hamilton attorney, Harvey Chesley., Sr. J. B. had received his degree by correspondence from LaSalle’s Extension University on July 20, 1917, in a scant four months. So confident was he of his ability to graduate and pass the Texas Bar that on the day of his graduation he had his personal stationary printed with a letterhead styled as follows.^8</p>

<p>J. B. Wieser</p>

<p>Attorney-At-Law</p>

<p>Hamilton, Texas.</p>

<p>Just eleven days later he passed the Texas Bar and was formally admitted to the practice of law in the State of Texas. He had already hung out his shingle in Hamilton, expecting fully to stay there. But within weeks, the anti-German incidents were increasing to such a degree that less than a month thereafter he felt he should consider leaving the area. The fact that it was also deep in the heart of Ku Klux Klan territory also did not provide much chance for escaping the wrath of those who also opposed anyone born in a foreign country.</p>

<p>At the time he arrived in Fredericksburg he had not yet lived in the United States the required amount of time to qualify for citizenship. He had filed his application with the Bexar County District Clerk on April 22, 1915, while studying in San Antonio.</p>

<p>However, since April 4, 1917 the United States had been at war with his native country. J. B. was now classified as an enemy alien by President Wilson and being such and living in a country with which the United States was engaged in war was not a good thing. His practice in Hamilton had hardly earned him a penny and his prospect of attracting clients was daily becoming less likely.</p>

<p>Fredericksburg, J. B. concluded might be a safer place to ride out the tide of anti-German sentiment sweeping the nation and from which even Texas was no longer immune.</p>

<p>The four-year old San Antonio, Fredericksburg and Great Northern Railway Depot consisted of only a single, small wooden-framed structure and was obviously owned by a railroad that was severely underfunded. But, Fredericksburg was finally linked to the world by rail and to the local citizens it meant that perhaps the town would finally grow. The depot was located south of town in an area still surrounded by small fields and many post oaks whose branches arched skyward against the cloudless western sky as the last rays of the August sun were nearing an end of their journey. The strong, but decidedly warm southern breeze was beginning to give evidence of dying down and by all indications it was going to be a hot August night, his first to be spent at this elevation.^9 Baron’s Creek separated the new depot from the rest of town that lay parallel to the tracks and directly to the north. Its streets were still hidden by a forest of trees that lined the small creek. Only a simple wooden bridge, located at the far western end of the depot linked the depot to the town.</p>

<p>All of Texas was experiencing an oil boom in the second decade of the new 20th century. That was even apparent in Fredericksburg by the number of newly built fuel depots built along the southwestern portions of the railroad track along which he now walked past. J.B. would soon notice that it was also apparent by the number of filling-stations that were springing up along San Saba Street^10 and that were serving the growing number of automobiles that were now beginning to appear and navigate the many potholes and obstacles found in the streets. Drivers needed gasoline, engine and tire repair, grease and oil, in what many obviously saw as opportunity for growth. Driving by car or truck was still an arduous task in 1917 because of poorly maintained roads, the poor lifespan of tires, and engines that often performed more stubbornly than mules. That was why the coming of the railroad has been so heartedly welcomed in Fredericksburg. It just might provide a boom to Fredericksburg that led to more jobs and more opportunities for employment. The coming of the railroad also meant that this isolated hamlet was now accessible by rail and now in a matter of hours. But Fredericksburg had had the railroad for only a year at the time of J. B.’s arrival. It had not had a chance to enjoy much of the change normally brought by the coming of a railroad.</p>

<p>As J. B. had boarded the train in San Antonio, he had heard more and more German being spoken and upon entering the station in Fredericksburg he heard nothing, but German. He had enjoyed friendly conversations with fellow passengers and upon arriving he was feeling quite at home, but he left open to himself the question as to whether he would remain here. It was a decision that had decided not to make quickly. He would take his time. Bringing only a small valise with him this time he had not much to carry. Already he had asked on board if anyone knew of a place where he might find a room with furnished meals. He could not afford to stay at the famous Nimitz Hotel. He was soon given the name of other establishments one of which might be able to accommodate him. Arriving at the depot, he was now anxious to get settled in for the night. Advised by several, he was told to inquire at the establishment of Katherine Zimmermann,^11 who along with her husband, operated a boarding house at 415 West Sam Antonio.</p>

<p>J. B. quickly confirmed directions and promptly started out. Lights filled some of the windows of the houses that lined the streets on the northern side of Barons Creek with am assorted warm and welcoming glow. Meanwhile, a steady, southerly breeze of warm air -came from the south and rustled leaves in the canopies of the trees that towered above him. He quickened his steps being hungrier than he had previously thought. Now, he began reminding himself of what he had planned to do. If the food he found there was good and had accommodations to his liking he would take a room there for a few days. If things worked out he would return to Hamilton for his things and the two matching steamer trunks with which he had arrived in Galveston and containing all his worldly possessions.^12 The move could be made quickly, he reasoned. He had time. J.B. quickly headed west from the depot to 5th Street, turned north and walked to San Antonio Street crossing Barons Creek with its small flow of babbling water enroot to join the waters of the Pedernales somewhere to the east. Although a much smaller brook than the Aach from his home town, it was a refreshing reminder of what he missed most living in the Hamilton area. The streams here ran clear. Those in Hamilton were muddy. Then he turned west and discovered that the town’s blocks running east to west were twice as long as normal city blocks. This definitely wasn’t Hico whose streets had been laid out in short, square blocks.</p>

<p>His three-block walk west on San Antonio proved to be equal to at least six normal city blocks. He would have to endure more minutes of the waning summer’s sun before arriving at last at the establishment of Lena Zimmermann. There, nestled on the southern side of the street near the bottom of a small hill, just west from the St. Mary’s Catholic Church that he had passed, stood a two-story, wooden house with a long front porch across the front. Approaching, he heard voices, obviously voices filtering through the opened, screened windows of diners enjoying their supper. Through its front door he could see a number of people sitting at a long table laden with food. Nevertheless, he knocked. It startled those dining. No one had ever knocked on Lena’s front door.</p>

<p>Someone shouted to come inside. Entering, he set down his small valise to introduce himself to Lena. He announced that he had been told he could find boarding with her and should she have room he would stay the night. However, he added, first he wanted to test her cooking before he committed to staying longer. Would she oblige him and serve him a meal?</p>

<p>What Lena might have thought of the brash gentleman who had just dropped in on this late summer afternoon is not known, but being only 12 years her junior J. B. and Lena would eventually develop a very special relationship that will last until her death some thirty-five years later. They will actually like one another. J. B. also did not escape the attention of one of Lena’s daughters, Estella, who at sixteen had often already started wondering whom she would marry one day. Estella was already in her fourth year at helping her mother run her business, having finally been forced to drop out of school after the sixth grade to earn money picking cotton. She had actually had been picking cotton since the age of six. Now, no long able to attend school she watched with envy her former friends go off to school each morning. What J. B. obviously could not have known at the time is that he had just introduced himself to his future mother-in-law and met his future wife. But, tonight, he was just happy to enjoy a hearty meal, one that he had not been able to afford in a long, long time. It was as if he had returned to Germany. Everyone spoke German and he found it wonderful. Additionally, he had also found a place to sleep. Tomorrow would be the beginning of a new adventure in Texas.</p>

<p>The next morning arrived far too soon and the morning in this Texas Hill Country hamlet was actually quite refreshing.</p>

<p>Lena, with the help of her children had prepared breakfast and set places for all their guests. A full breakfast awaited J. B. as he arose, dressed, and came down to have breakfast. Again, he invoked stares from the other borders who noted the smartly starched collar attached to a fresh, clean, white shirt and his formal business attire. This, they mused snickeringly to one another, was no ordinary man. But nothing fazed J. B. He had grown used and indifferent to such snide comments. Today he would begin assessing them and how they measured up to his expectations for they, not he, were the object of his mission. He would explore town, assess its potential and then focus on deciding whether this town would suffice and satisfy his immediate needs. He did not know it that morning, but his situation as an alien would become far worse in the coming weeks, not better in his immediate future.^13 But, for now, he had other things with which to contend and finding a permanent room with good meals came first. A verdict on his first decision was easily returned. As he finished his meal, he folded his napkin and nodded his approval to Lena. He had found his place to stay, if Lena would permit him.</p>

<p>Beginning a new law practice was not easy and he had had not much of a chance in Hamilton. Normally, it helped if one knew a town’s citizens. Those who were starting out in law and had been reared among those they now planned to serve were at a distinct advantage. They had likely gone to school with them, lived among them as neighbors, and had family. People have a tendency to choose their legal council from among those they have grown to know and trust. He knew no one. His appearance and manners would mean everything. First impressions were always important. Already his dress had caused a stir among those stilllingering over their coffee that morning, but J. B. might also have had an air about him that emanated from years of telling himself to hold his head up high and believing that one should always think positively of oneself. That he was intelligent, there can be no question, but intelligence often makes others uncomfortable. In Fredericksburg J. B. was this morning a complete stranger and a stranger in a town that did not readily accept newcomers, especially those who had recently come from Germany to live among them. The majority of the settlers had arrived in Fredericksburg in the decade following its founding; that period having occurred some 50-60 years before J. B.’s arrival. Anyone not descending from these founding families was and remained an outsider, and as J.B. would eventually learn, forever.</p>

<p>J. B. would first take notice of the stares he received from these descendants the first time he attended Sunday mass at the St. Mary’s Catholic Church, the church which he had discovered was only a block from where he now resided. Those sitting in their rightful pews glared at the new stranger occupying one of their pews and participating in their services. Many certainly wondered by what right that stranger felt by which he thought that he could receive the sacraments in their church. Later, J. B. would say that it was for that very reason he finally quit going to church. Sunday after Sunday he was greeted only with stares as the local towns people watched his every move and spoke in whispers to one another about the new stranger in their midst and the one staying at Lena’s boardinghouse. What decent gentleman would take a room with her? Before Christmas, 1917, he had had enough. But, quitting will cost him any chance of winning many Catholic clients for Catholics, as for any other group in town, had a tendency to patronize one of their own.^14 If he were to remain, he had to win the confidence of enough citizens to support his practice. He had just made his road more difficult and far more lonesome.</p>

<p>Until now, he had made no real friends in Texas save for Harvey Chesley, Jr. and his father. It did not help that he appeared to lack the ability to really make real friends. He presented himself as being cold, perhaps even aloof and he might have even preferred it that way. Except of the junior Chesley, under whose dad he had been permitted to study law, he had no one with whom he cared to remain in contact from the Hamilton. He had stopped writing and sending postcards to his friends in Europe when he had immigrated. And since the outbreak of war writing them had become impossible. Chesley’s dad had permitted him to use his law books although it is unknown what J. B. paid Chesley, if anything, for his help. For now, however, he was scouting a new town and its people, exploring available office space. If there was any certainly about J. B. at the end of his first day in Fredericksburg, it was that he now knew that he would not return to the Hamilton area as long as the war continued between the United States and Germany. J.B. had found a new home.</p>

<p>In the coming days J. B. found and rented a small office upstairs in the Gold Building. The rooms 11 &amp; 12 at 136 East Main were well centered in town for offices. They were close to everything and everyone who was important. He hung out his shingle and ran his first advertisement on the front page of the weekly <em>_<strong>Friedrichsburg Wochenbatt</strong>_</em> , right opposite that, he happened to notice an ad placed by Alfred C. P. Petsch,^15 a local home grown lawyer with whom J. B. would spend a lifetime in what often became a bitter duel. J. B. was ready to make his fortune, but it would not be easy. He returned to Hamilton to collect the last of his belongings in the coming weeks, but he was not, however, absolutely certain that he would not return there one day. For now, however, he curtailed his doubts.</p>

<p>J. B. would have to work at getting known. He could come across as being arrogant and often being obviously intelligent could have its drawbacks. J. B. could also be very blunt and outspoken, which some admired and others resented, but above everything else he was completely honest. Certainly, there were a few who enjoyed his company and some likely engaged him in debates on current events. But he had learned much earlier not to discuss Germany. Even while among so many of German descent, he thought it best not to get involved about Germany. The town did not lack a dearth of individuals who loved nothing better to do than talk. And, J. B. loved to engage in storytelling. It was all part of what lawyers had to do to win clients at that time; become known, set an example, to stay visible and be accessible when needed. But, use of such time for telling stories meant that little money was coming in while rent, lodging and food costs continued daily.</p>

<p>He was still a dapper dresser even after being removed from the lakeside villages he had known in Germany. He had a flair for style that he had not entirely abandoned. Clean, crisp white shirts, starched stiff collars, ties and stick pins, pressed pants, garters for his socks and a nice coat still mattered to him for he knew appearances mattered, but it did cost money. And money was still in very short supply for him. He shopped at the local haberdasheries frequently and he kept up with the fashions to the extent that mattered at the time and what men’s clothing stores thought they could sell to their customers. Renting two rooms meant that the rent for them continued month after month with or without an income. Likewise his rent for room and board continued with or without clients as well. J. B. would have to look to other ventures to supplement his legal career quickly or he would soon find himself without money.</p>

<p>In the immediate years that followed he would still considered leaving the legal profession and going into business, but establishing a business also required money. He had none. His Uncle Vincent was dead and he could not easily go back to his cousins without admitting failure, which would have been much to their delight, and that, he had vowed that he would never do. J. B. was still determined to make his fortune in America. Four months earlier, on April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson had appeared before a joint session of Congress and asked for a declaration of war against his native Germany. Two days later Congress honored his request and J. B. became an enemy alien living in a country at war with that of his birth. Germans everywhere were questioned about their loyalty to the United States. A witch hunt was beginning to be unleashed across the country the likes of which had not been seen since the American Revolution or the Civil War. Even in towns such as Fredericksburg, where Germans should be safe from harassment, those of German descent had to be careful in all their actions lest they be viewed with suspicion. J. B. knew he still had to be careful.</p>

<p>But hiding among others of German descent might have been a good move, but only if one could blend in with those already here. J. B. would try, but to a larger degree he could never quite fit in with the rest. During the next forty-three years he lived and worked among the citizens of Gillespie County, willing to sacrifice his time to help the county grow. For decades he tried to win elections in order to serve, efficiently and honestly, but in the end he felt rejected and finally realized that his adopted community still considered him nothing more than an outsider. Realizing that might have depressed an ordinary man, but J.B. adopted a more philosophical attitude. He reasoned that it was their loss, not his.</p>

<p>J. B. decided to stay. He married a local girl and they reared a family of five. Their proudest accomplishment was being able to send all five to college to earn professional degrees. He set a high standard for them even if it terms were never directly spelled out. They were felt and understood. He needed very little of available comforts to live a comfortable life. Having enough to eat was never an issue. With Stella’s help they reared their family on a very frugal budget. At the end of his life, J. B. could look back with great satisfaction of having had the opportunity to live the American Dream. He had arrived on her shores practically penniless and in debt to his Uncle Vincent who had made his journey possible. J. B. was determined to succeed. To do so meant he needed to learn English and learn it in the shortest time possible. Seeing no future with his uncle’s family he studied law. He became dependent on no one, but his own skills.</p>

<p>The move to Fredericksburg proved to be a successful one and he could look back on a life well-spent in the pursuit of taking advantage of what opportunities America offered it citizens. He saw that early on and obviously felt puzzled why others such as his brother saw it not at all. But, as the decades slipped by he began to fear that even Americans were becoming spoiled and that more and more were failing to understand what their nation meant to those who desired an opportunity to make the most of their lives. Might Americans one day fail to comprehend what great opportunities lay before them? At the end he feared that America too would turn to socialism. He had experienced its incessant adherence beginning with President Wilson’s meddling in his Uncle Vincent’s exports and fully nourished by F.D.R.’s New Deal that ate away many American’s belief in self-reliance by causing a recession to develop into a prolonged depression, and finally the feisty commitment to a Fair Deal of Harry Truman under whose leadership America appeared to lose it commitment to challenge communism. In the end he feared his children would live under socialism, if not communism itself. He was not wrong to be worried.</p>

<p>The march to living under socialism has not ceased since J. B.’s death more than half a century ago. We might already be too far down the path to return to the principals of working hard, educating oneself, and feeling good about one’s accomplishment.</p>

<p>The blame game appears to be winning in the 21st century. Now we are daily being fed the idea that it is the fault of others that one does not get ahead. Sadly, J. B. might yet be proven right.</p>

<p>J. B. and His American Dream is the story of J. B. Wieser, who was determined to succeed in America. He built his law practice from scratch and with the help of Estella; his wife reared his children in the values of hard work and getting an education.</p>

<p>He never ceased to appreciate the opportunity he felt that America had offered him and was available to everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Prologue Footnotes</strong></p>

<p>(^4) The approaching winter, 1917-1918, will prove to be the 10th coldest in recorded history for Texas. The El Nino effect was still unknown at that time, but Fredericksburg was about to receive a little over nine inches of snow. It would snow double that amount during the winter of 1918-1919. [1] McCullough, Patrick A., <em>_<strong>West Central Texas during El Nino: A Look at Snowfall</strong>_</em> , - <a href="http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sjt//images/hydrology/ENSOsnow.pdf">http://www.srh.noaa.gov/sjt//images/hydrology/ENSOsnow.pdf</a> - accessed June 7, 2009. So it was good that he still had it.</p>

<p>(^5) From conversations with my father, ca 1950-1959.</p>

<p>(^6) Vincent Wieser was actually the nephew to Wendelin’s father. Vincent and Wendelin were first cousins and Vincent was officially a second cousin to Joseph (J. B.) Because of Vincent’s age he had earned the respect typically accorded that of an uncle.</p>

<p>(^7) Vincent was a first cousin to Wendelin. Their fathers had been brothers. Vincent’s dad, being the older brother, took his inheritance and brought his family to Iowa in 1851, young Vincent included. German custom requires that older persons, such as Vincent, be shown respect. Hence he was called Uncle Vincent. Nevertheless, Vincent was only a second cousin to J. B.</p>

<p>(^8) J.B. had a thing about using letterheads and used them on almost every letter he wrote home, beginning, of course, already in Langenargen, Germany.</p>

<p>(^9) Fredericksburg is about 1,750 feet above sea level. For persons from Central Texas where the elevation is much lower, the lack of as much humidity is quite noticeable. Without a cooling late evening breeze from the south, however, mid-August nights can remain quite warm.</p>

<p>(^10) San Saba Street was changed to Main Street in 1930s.</p>

<p>(^11) Katherine, or Lena as she was called by her friends, had been on her own since being disowned by her family after becoming pregnant at the age of 18 and bringing disgrace and shame to them. She did not marry the father and chose to rear her child herself.</p>

<p>Lena Hahn had been born in 1874 and had grown up along Pecan Creek, an area a dozen miles west of town. She and her first child were on their own. Four more children followed in 1895, 1897, 1901 and 1904. She earned money by cleaning houses and, eventually took a job at Captain Nimitz’s Hotel. While working there she realized that she could probably earn more by taking in borders and cooking meals. Consequently, she began her own boarding house, renting houses here and there, even moving her growing family to Kerrville in 1905; becoming a neighbor and friend to Charles and Florence Butt. Florence, like Lena, was raising her children practically alone as her husband was stricken with tuberculosis and unable to work or help her as she became an agent for the A&amp;P Tea Company, taking and delivering grocery orders door to door. Returning to Fredericksburg, now with five children in tow, she was married to Otto Zimmerman around 1909, a cigar maker who worked for Jacob Kraus Cigar Company, and with whom she had four more children. By 1917 she was operating out of a two-story wooden house near the west end of San Antonio Street. There she largely ran the boarding house with the help of her children. Otto too, had 5 children of his own and it is doubtful that with that many mouths to feed that there was much left over at the end of the month. It also didn’t help that Otto apparently worked when he wanted and reportedly spent the winters in bed as Lena doted on him much to the resentment of her children. Lena, fortunately, was a good cook and her reputation for providing hearty meals was legendary as well as inexpensive. As was the custom at that time, mid-mornings and mid-afternoons, meant <em><strong>Kaffee Klatsches</strong></em>. Everyone took a time-out for a cup of hot coffee and freshly-made <em><strong>Fettkrefel</strong></em> (doughnuts; many simply made with a hole in the traditional way, but also many that were twisted and fried and they looked like twisted braids.) A large rectangular deep roasting pan full of doughnuts was quickly made and set upon the table for all. A large coffee pot was always on her stove and her kitchen was always open to the many neighbors, friends and acquaintances made it a point to drop in every day to gather around the kitchen table for Gemüdlichkeit at its very best. Later, when Lena operated the Central Hotel across from the courthouse Lena’s legendary cooking would win her the contract to feed the county’s prisoners. She delivered meals to the old jail three times daily. Those prisoners were, without a doubt, the best-fed prisoners in the state. But, on this hot late summer evening she was soon about to be tested by a smartly dressed gentleman with a decidedly German accent.</p>

<p>(^12) The larger of these matching two-piece steamer trunks survived years in smoke houses, barns and warehouses. The larger one is now in the home of J.B.’s granddaughter, who, incidentally, now lives in the house J. B. had built out on the farm off Goehmann Lane in 1922.</p>

<p>(^13) From November 1917 to April 1918, all "alien enemies" were ordered to register with the U. S. Marshal in their county of residence, by order of President Wilson. All of those aliens were any of those persons who had - for whatever reason - not been naturalized. http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/kcgs/alienbyco.htm](http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/kcgs/alienbyco.htm) - accessed May 30, 2009.</p>

<p>(^14) Fredericksburg was almost equally split between Lutherans and Catholics. Although both Catholics and Lutherans worshiped in the first community church (Vereins Kirche), the two separated quickly. The Catholics had developed their own school. Catholic patronized Catholic groceries, such as Knopp and Metzgers; Protestants bought groceries at those owned by non-Catholics. The town will be divided by newspaper readers in just a few years, with the new Radio Post taking many non-Catholic readers from the Fredericksburg Wochenblatt. Even at death, Catholics will Schaetter Funeral Home and the Protestants, Beckmann’s. In death, Catholics are buried in the holy concentrated grounds of the Catholic cemetery; Protestants in the City Cemetery. To complicate matters for J. B., Lena, a protestant, is now married to Otto, a Catholic. Five of her children before marrying Otto are protestant. All four she has with Otto are Catholic.</p>

<p>(^15) The C. P. stood for Casper Peter. Estella will often jokingly refer to him as Alfred Casper Peter Petsch. Saying it out loud it had a certain ring about it that was funny. He and J. B. would remain life-long rivals and obviously detested each other. As a 14 year old boy I was once sent down to Col. Petsch’s law office to fetch some important documents for my father. It was a passage of rites that I had finally attained an age at which I could be entrusted with such valuable documents. Entering his office I could sense that Col. Petsch was astonished and had no intention of handing such valuable papers to me. Was my dad being funny? Col. Petsch called my dad to question my dad’s wisdom in sending me to fetch them. I could see his face redden as he heard my dad’s reply. My father had blistered him. I suspect that J. B. had planned the whole thing just to irritate the Colonel. The Colonel quickly handed me the documents with no further comment. I really felt proud and pleased as I delivered them safely to my father.</p>

      <p>HAMILTON, TEXAS (Hamilton County). Hamilton, the county seat of Hamilton County, in the Pecan Creek valley in the center of the county. The first settlers came to the area in            1855. Hamilton became the county seat when the county was founded in 1858 and was named, like the county, for South Carolina governor James Hamilton. The Civil War and Indian              attacks,     which continued until 1876, slowed the growth of Hamilton. By 1896 Hamilton had a population of 1,100, a grocery, two saloons, and three general stores. In 1899 a         flood       destroyed many of the homes in Hamilton and drowned one resident. Railroad service did not begin until 1907-08, when the Stephenville, North and South Texas Railway        was extended from Stephenville to Hamilton. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The Grand Prairie and Plains consist of both wide lowlands, and limestone mesa uplands. The topography is considered hilly, rolling, and well-drained beneath which lie limestone         rock layers interbedded with clays and neutral to slightly acidic soils which support a range of tall grass in the prairie in the east to shorter grasses in the prairies in the            est.      The bottom lands support pecans, black walnut, black willow, cottonwood, but is being overrun by the invasive woody vegetation of the honey mesquite and Ashe juniper.        - http://texastreeid.tamu.edu/content/texasecoregions/GrandPrairiePlains/](http://texastreeid.tamu.edu/content/texasecoregions/GrandPrairiePlains/) - accessed February 7, 2014. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
